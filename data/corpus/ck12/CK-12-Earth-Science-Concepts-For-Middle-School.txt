Introduction

How is science different from other ways of understanding the world?
If someone asks you, “What is science?” you might say that it’s a bunch of facts and explanations. But that’s only
part of the story. Science is a knowledge base. But science is also a way of learning about the world. Earth science is
about our planet and its environments. Earth scientists study Earth’s surface and interior. They study why volcanoes
erupt and why some places are mountainous and some are entirely ﬂat. Some Earth scientists are interested in the
weather. Others want to know about the oceans. There are even Earth scientists who apply what they know about
Earth to learning about space. Some Earth scientists do a lot of their work in the ﬁeld, as seen above.

Chapter 1. What is Science?

1.1 Scientiﬁc Explanations and Interpretations

• Deﬁne science.
• Identify and deﬁne facts, explanations, and opinions.
• Distinguish between facts and opinions.

What is a fact?
Science is different from other ways of thinking. It is based on facts. Gravity is a fact. If you let go of a ball, it will
fall to the ground. Can you tell a fact from an opinion? Can you tell when an idea follows logically from a fact?
Basing ideas on facts is essential to good science.

Facts, Observations, Opinions

Science is a set of facts, and it is also a set of explanations that are based on those facts. Science relies on facts to
explain the natural world.
Scientists usually begin an investigation with facts. A fact is a bit of information that is true. Facts come from data
collected from observations. Facts can also come from experiments that have been run. Data is factual information
that results from an investigation. Facts and data are not subject to opinion or bias. An opinion is someone’s
subjective view or position on a subject.
What is a fact? Look at the following list.

7. Average global temperature has risen since 1900.

An Analysis

The following is an analysis of the statements above:

1. This is a fact. The fact comes from observation.
2. The ﬁrst sentence is a fact from observation. The woman is sneezing. The second sentence is an opinion. She
might have a cold, or she might have allergies or the ﬂu. Tests could be done to see what is causing her illness.
This opinion could become fact if the tests show that she actually has a cold, or it could be proven wrong.

3. This is a fact. Many, many scientiﬁc experiments have shown that colds are caused by viruses.
4. This statement sounds like a fact. However, the scientiﬁc evidence is mixed. One reputable study published
in 2007 showed a decrease in colds of 58% in people who used echinacea. Several other studies have shown
no beneﬁcial effect.

5. Bill Gates is the wealthiest man in the United States; that’s a fact. However, there’s no evidence that he’s also

the smartest man; this is an opinion.

6. This sounds like a fact, but it is not. There must be data to support the statement. How would you test
it? Gather together a large number of subjects, each with a friend. Have the friends ﬁll out a questionnaire
describing the subject. Match the traits against the person’s astrological sign. Do the astrological predictions
ﬁt? Are Leos actually more ﬁery, self-assured, and charming? Tests like this have not supported the claims of
astrologers. However, astrologers have not modiﬁed their opinions.

7. This is a fact. The following graph shows the temperature anomaly since 1880 ( Figure 1.2). There’s no doubt

that average global temperature has risen since 1880. The largest rise has been since the late 1970s.

Summary

• Facts are true. Data, gathered correctly, is factual. Facts and data are not subject to opinion or bias.
• Facts can be determined by observations or experiments.
• Some statements that appear to be facts are not.
• All scientiﬁc explanations and interpretations are based on facts.

1.2 Scientiﬁc Method

• Describe a scientiﬁc question.
• Explain the scientiﬁc method.

How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?
This is a question that has been pondered over the centuries. Can it be answered using the scientiﬁc method? Is it a
scientiﬁc question?

The Goal of Science

The goal of science is to answer questions about the natural world. Asking (and answering) questions is integral
to the process of science. Scientiﬁc questions must be testable. Which of these two questions is a good scientiﬁc
question and which is not?

• What is the age of our planet Earth?
• How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?

The ﬁrst is a good scientiﬁc question. It can be answered by age-dating rocks and by using other techniques. The
second question cannot be answered using data. It is not a scientiﬁc question.

Scientiﬁc Method

Chapter 1. What is Science?

Scientists use the scientiﬁc method to answer questions. The scientiﬁc method is a series of steps. These steps help
scientists (or even just people!) investigate a question.
Often, students learn that the scientiﬁc method goes from step to step to step in a speciﬁc order, like so:

• Ask a question. The question can be based on one or more observations or on data from a previous experiment.
• Do some background research.
• Create a hypothesis. Use your imagination and reasoning skills.
• Conduct experiments or make observations to test the hypothesis.
• Gather the data.
• Use logical reasoning to formulate a conclusion.

In reality, however, the process doesn’t always go in a straight line. A scientist might ask a question and then start
doing some background research. During his research, he may discover that his original question needed to be asked
in a different way, or that an entirely different question should be asked. As a result, he is brought back to the ﬁrst
step of the scientiﬁc method.
A ﬂow chart of how science works can be found here: http://undsci.berkeley.edu/lessons/pdfs/complex_ﬂow_han
dout.pdf .

Ask a Question

Now, let’s ask a scientiﬁc question. Remember that it must be testable.
We learned in the previous concept, "Scientiﬁc Explanations and Interpretations," that the average global temperature
has been on the rise. Scientists know that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the
atmosphere. This leads us to a question:
Question: Is the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere changing?
This is a good scientiﬁc question because it is testable.

FIGURE 1.3
According to data collected at the Mauna
Loa Observatory in Hawaii, atmospheric
carbon dioxide has been increasing since
record keeping began in 1958. The small
ups and downs of the red line are due
to seasonal changes in the winter and
summer. The black line traces the annual
average.

7

1.2. Scientiﬁc Method

www.ck12.org

How has carbon dioxide in the atmosphere changed since 1958 ( Figure 1.3)? The line on the graph is going up so
carbon dioxide has increased. About how much has it increased in parts per million?

Answer a Question

So we’ve answered the question. We used data from research that has already been done. Fortunately, scientists have
been monitoring CO2 levels over the years. If they hadn’t, we’d have to start these measurements now.
Because this question can be answered with data, it is testable.

Summary

• Scientiﬁc questions must be testable.
• Scientists use the scientiﬁc method to answer questions about the natural world.

1.3 Development of Hypotheses

• Deﬁne hypothesis.
• Summarize the characteristics of a scientiﬁc hypothesis.

What is a hypothesis?
An educated guess? Is that what you learned a hypothesis is? Lots of people have learned that, but it’s not exactly
right. So what is a hypothesis? There are two hypotheses listed below. They address a question about carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere. Check out what those hypotheses are. Then we’ll see what to do with them next.

Asking a New Question

First, we need to ﬁnd a question that we want to answer. Let’s start with the fact that atmospheric CO2 has been
increasing since 1958. This leads us to ask the following: why is atmospheric CO2 increasing?

Possible Answers to the Question

A hypothesis is a reasonable explanation for a small range of phenomena. A hypothesis is limited in scope; it
attempts to explain a single event or a fact. A hypothesis must be testable and falsiﬁable. In other words, we must
be able to test it, and we must be able to disprove it.
Back to answering the question. Let’s say we do some background research to learn the possible sources of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere. We discover that there are at least two (there are actually many more):

• CO2 is released into the atmosphere by volcanoes when they erupt.
• CO2 is released when fossil fuels are burned.

From these two facts, we can create two hypotheses; we will have multiple working hypotheses. We can test each
of these hypotheses. We can prove either or both of these hypotheses false. In this case, it’s even possible that both
are true.

1.3. Development of Hypotheses

Hypothesis 1

www.ck12.org

Atmospheric CO2 has increased over the past ﬁve decades because the amount of CO2 gas released by volcanoes
has increased.

Hypothesis 2

The increase in atmospheric CO2 is due to the increase in the amount of fossil fuels that are being burned.
Usually, testing a hypothesis requires making observations or performing experiments. In this case, we will look into
existing scientiﬁc literature to see if either of these hypotheses can be disproved, or if one or both can be supported
by the data.

Summary

• A hypothesis is a reasonable explanation for a small range of phenomena.
• A scientiﬁc hypothesis must be both testable and falsiﬁable.
• If two or more hypotheses are being tested, they are called multiple working hypotheses.

Chapter 1. What is Science?

1.4 Testing Hypotheses

• Identify and explain the steps required to test a hypothesis.

How can I show that my hypothesis is wrong?
Many young scientists learn that a good scientist tries to disprove her hypothesis. This is the best way to be sure
that your hypothesis is getting a rigorous test. Why do you think established scientists tell students this? Why is it a
good idea?

Testing Hypotheses

How do you test a hypothesis? Often you need scientiﬁc tools, perhaps a microscope or a magnetometer. You need
to know how to analyze the data that comes from those tools. Often computers are needed to gather, analyze, and
interpret the data.
In this example, we will look into the scientiﬁc literature to ﬁnd data. These studies were done using scientiﬁc
method. The scientists used the necessary tools and computers. To test a new hypothesis, we would need to do the
experiments ourselves.
We will test the two hypothesis that we developed to explain this fact: Atmospheric CO2 has increased over the past
ﬁve decades.

Testing Hypothesis 1

Hypothesis 1: Atmospheric CO2 has increased over the past ﬁve decades because the amount of CO2 gas released
by volcanoes has increased.

11

1.4. Testing Hypotheses

www.ck12.org

To test Hypothesis 1, we need to see if the amount of CO2 gas released by volcanoes over the past several decades
has increased.
There are two ways volcanoes could account for the increase in CO2:

• There has been an increase in volcanic eruptions in that time.
• The CO2 content of volcanic gases has increased over time globally.

To test the ﬁrst possibility, we can look at scientiﬁc literature from a site like http://www.volcano.si.edu/education/
questions/index.cfm?faq=06. Our research tells us that 50-70 eruptions occur every year. We see that the number
of volcanic eruptions is about constant. We learn from different scientiﬁc papers that volcanic gas compositions
have not changed over time. Different types of volcanoes have different gas compositions. However, the overall the
gases are the same. Another scientiﬁc paper states that major volcanic eruptions for the past 30 years have caused
short-term cooling, not warming!
Hypothesis 1 is wrong! Volcanic activity is not able to account for the rise in atmospheric CO2. Remember that
science is falsiﬁable. We can discard Hypothesis 1.
When a hypothesis is wrong, often much has been learned anyway. Rarely is the pursuit of a hypothesis a total loss!

Testing Hypothesis 2

Hypothesis 2: The increase in atmospheric CO2 is due to the increase in the amount of fossil fuels that are being
burned.
To test hypothesis 2, we need to see if the amount of CO2 gas released by fossil fuels over the past several decades
has increased. We look into the scientiﬁc literature and ﬁnd the following graph ( Figure 1.4).

FIGURE 1.4
Global carbon dioxide emissions from fos-
sil fuel consumption and cement produc-
tion. The black line represents all emis-
sion types combined. The colored lines
show emissions from individual fossil fu-
els.

Fossil fuels have added an increasing amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere since the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution in the mid 19th century. Hypothesis 2 appears to be at least partly true!
It is very important when testing hypotheses to eliminate any bias. A biased researcher may miss important factors
that do not match his bias. It actually is good to try to disprove your own hypothesis! Having other researchers
involved will also help to eliminate bias.

Summary

• Science is falsiﬁable. An incorrect hypothesis is discarded.

12

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1. What is Science?

• Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are increasing. Fossil fuel burning is increasing. The rise in fossil

fuel burning is increasing the CO2 in the atmosphere.

• More than one hypothesis can be tested at a time. This is called multiple working hypotheses.

Review

1. Could there be other reasons that CO2 has been increasing in the atmosphere for the past several decades?

Could there be more than one reason?

2. At this moment, can we say that the increase in fossil fuel burning is causing the increase in CO2 in the

atmosphere?

3. At this moment, can we say that the increase in fossil fuel burning is causing the rise in average global

temperature?

4. What do we need to do next to address the last two questions?

1.5. Correlation and Causation

www.ck12.org

1.5 Correlation and Causation

• Deﬁne correlation and causation.
• Distinguish between correlation and causation.

Sugar consumption is up. Global temperatures are up. Is one causing the other?
Is the rise in sugar consumption in America causing the average global temperature to rise? Are rising temperatures
causing people to eat more sugar? Both of these factors are rising, but how are they related? Are they related by
correlation, causation, or both?

Correlation

We made a few discoveries so far in this concept:

• Average global temperature has been rising for the past several decades.
• Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been rising for the past several decades.
• Carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning have been rising for the past several

decades.

A correlation is the mutual relationship between two or more things. We see here a correlation between three things:
(1) CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning are rising (2) atmospheric CO2 levels are rising, and (3) average global
temperatures are rising. These three things exhibit positive correlation. They are all going in the same direction.

14

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1. What is Science?

If one factor rises while another sinks they have negative correlation. For example, the amount of forest land is
decreasing. This factor has a negative correlation with global temperature.

Causation

But correlation does not necessarily indicate causation. Causation refers to the factor that is producing the effect.
If I push a toy car, I will cause it to move. To explain the difference between correlation and causation, let’s look at
an example. Sugar consumption in the United States has been rising for decades ( Figure 1.5). There is a positive
correlation between sugar consumption and rising average global temperatures.

FIGURE 1.5
American consumption of sugar, 1970-
2009.

Is the rise in sugar consumption causing the rise in global temperatures? Is the rise in global temperatures causing
the rise in sugar consumption? These two things aren’t impossible, but they are extremely unlikely. There’s no
mechanism for one to increase the other. Here there is correlation, not causation. To establish causation we need to
know how one would cause the other.

Fossil Fuel Burning Causes Temperatures to Rise

Here is a brief outline of the way an increase in CO2 can increase global temperatures. This is a logical step-by-step
argument. There is no part of this explanation that goes beyond the evidence.

• Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat. CO2 is a greenhouse gas.
• Burning fossil fuels releases CO2 into the atmosphere.
• The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more heat can be trapped.
• The more heat that’s trapped, the warmer average global temperatures are.

Because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, increased CO2 in the atmosphere causes average global temperatures
to rise. We found one cause for rising global temperatures. There are also others. Climate change science is dealt
with extensively in the chapters Atmospheric Processes and Weather and Climate.

Summary

• Correlation is a comparison of two factors within a population. Correlation does not imply causation.

• If one factor is responsible for the change in another factor, there is causation.
• Establishing causation requires a mechanism to show how one factor can inﬂuence the other.
• Burning fossil fuels releases CO2 into the atmosphere. That CO2 traps heat, which causes global temperatures

to rise.

1.6 Observations and Experiments

• Explain the role of observations and experiments in science.
• Distinguish between dependent and independent variables.

How do you test a hypothesis?
When you test a hypothesis, you must make observations or perform experiments. So far in this concept we have
used scientiﬁc papers that were published. The papers were available because scientists collected that data using
scientiﬁc method. If we asked a new question, we would need to do the testing ourselves. How might you do the
testing yourself?

Testing Hypotheses

To test a hypothesis you need data. How do you collect data? By making observations or running experiments.

Observations

Observations can happen on many scales. You can use a microscope to observe tiny things. You can use a telescope
to observe distant things in space. To learn about the effects of climate change, you could observe Earth’s surface.

17

1.6. Observations and Experiments

www.ck12.org

How would you make observations of Earth’s surface? You could do this from the land surface or from space. Many
important observations are made by orbiting satellites. These satellites have a bird’s eye view of how the planet is
changing ( Figure 1.6).

FIGURE 1.6
This satellite image shows the retreat of
the Jakobshavn Isbrae Glacier in Green-
land from 2001-2004.

Observations are made when it is not possible to do experiments. Scientists send devices to make observations in
dangerous places. They send devices to places that are difﬁcult for people to go. For example, many rovers have
been to Mars ( Figure 1.7). There will probably be many more before the ﬁrst human gets there.

FIGURE 1.7
Portrait of the Curiosity rover that landed on Mars on August 5, 2012.

Experiments

Answering some questions requires experiments. An experiment is a test that may be performed in the ﬁeld or in a
laboratory. An experiment must always be done under controlled conditions. The goal of an experiment is to test a
hypothesis. The data from the experiment will verify or falsify the hypothesis.

Variables

In an experiment, it is important to change only one factor. All other factors must be kept the same.

18

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1. What is Science?

• independent variable: The factor that will be changed.
• dependent variable: The factors that depend on the independent variable.

An experiment must have a control group. In the control group, nothing is changed. It is not subjected to the
independent variable. For example, say you want to test if Vitamin C prevents colds. You gather a large number of
people to be your sample group. Then you divide your sample group up. Some receive Vitamin C and some do not.
Those who do not receive the Vitamin C are the control group. Vitamin C is the independent variable.
Why should an experiment manipulate only one variable? Imagine a woman who eats a diet heavy on junk food.
She is low on energy and says she just doesn’t feel right. She decides to change her diet. She cuts out dairy products,
wheat, meat and reﬁned sugar. She also cuts out junk food. She feels better! She insists that the cause of her
new well-being is the lack of dairy, wheat, meat, and sugar. But it’s also possible that she feels better because
she eliminated junk food. In other words, she doesn’t know what made her feel better. Is it possible that it was
eliminating junk food that made her feel better? Is it possible it was eliminating wheat? Meat? Maybe she’s lactose
intolerant and it was milk. Of course, it could have been any of those things. She doesn’t know what it is that
made her feel better because she changed too many variables. How could she be more scientiﬁc about understanding
exactly what it was in her diet that was making her feel bad?

Experimental Error

Scientists make many measurements during experiments. Humans and equipment can make mistakes. Errors are
often unavoidable. This is called experimental error. Errors may be due to the equipment being used. In this case,
the numbers may be always skewed in one direction. For example, a scale may always measure one-half of an ounce
high. People can also make errors. A measurement may not be made precisely. For example, a stopwatch may be
stopped too soon or too late. But probably not always in the same direction. To correct for this, many measurements
are taken. The measurements are then averaged. Experiments always have a margin of error associated with them.

Summary

• Testing a hypothesis requires data. Data can be gathered by observations or by experiments.
• Observations can be done simply by looking at and measuring a phenomenon. Observations can also be done

by using advanced technology.

• Experiments must be well-designed. They must be done under controlled conditions. Only one variable should

be manipulated.

• Errors are always possible in human endeavors. Scientists have ways to reduce the effects of errors on their

data.

1.7 Development of Theories

• Deﬁne scientiﬁc theory.
• Summarize the theories of evolution, plate tectonics, and climate change.
• Distinguish between a scientiﬁc theory and law.

Do you have a theory about why this batter can’t hit?
This batter hasn’t hit a ball in his last 20 at bats. His coach has a theory: it’s because he needs glasses. The idea is a
good one, although it is not a theory. In common speech, the word theory is often misused. It is often misused when
referring to scientiﬁc ideas as well. What would be a better word to use?

Theory

Scientists collect evidence to test a hypothesis. The evidence may refute the hypothesis. In that case, it will be
thrown out. The evidence may support the hypothesis. The scientists will then gather more evidence. The scientists
will accept the hypothesis if: (1) There is no signiﬁcant evidence to refute the hypothesis. (2) There is an enormous
amount of evidence to support the hypothesis. The hypothesis may then become a theory.

21

1.7. Development of Theories

www.ck12.org

A scientiﬁc theory is supported by many types of evidence. It is a synthesis of evidence from many experiments
and observations. A theory has no major inconsistencies. A theory is a simple model of reality. It is simpler than the
phenomenon itself. A theory explains a phenomenon. Scientists can use a theory to make predictions.
A theory is constantly tested. If some data does not agree with the theory, the theory can be revised. If the theory
cannot match the data, it is thrown out. That being said, sometimes a theory is well-established; it has a lot of
evidence to back it up. A well-established theory is unlikely to be overthrown. It may just need to be modiﬁed a bit.
But science does not prove anything beyond a shadow of a doubt.

Three Essential Theories

The three theories below are essential in Earth science. Each accounts for an enormous amount of data. Each is
supported by many lines of evidence. All can be used to make predications. As new evidence arises, any of these
theories may need to be altered. But none of these three are likely ever to be disproved. They are accepted by nearly
all of the credible scientists in their ﬁelds.

The Theory of Evolution

Evolution means change over time. Darwin’s theory of evolution says that organisms change over time ( Figure
1.8). Evolution is seen in the fossil record. It is seen in the way organisms develop. Evolution is evident in the
geographic locations where organism are found. It is evident in the genes of living organisms. Evolution has a
mechanism called natural selection. The organism that is best suited to its environment is most likely to survive.
Evolution is described in the chapter Life on Earth.

FIGURE 1.8
The theory of evolution maintains that modern humans evolved from ape-
like ancestors.

The Theory of Plate Tectonics

Plate tectonics theory says that slabs of continents move around on Earth’s surface. The mechanism for that
movement is seaﬂoor spreading. Plate tectonics explain many things about Earth: (1) geological activity, why it
happens where it does; (2) natural resources, why many are found where they are; and (3) the past and future, what
happened in the past and what will happen in the future. The theory of plate tectonics will be explored in the chapter
Plate Tectonics.

22

www.ck12.org

The Theory of Climate Change

Chapter 1. What is Science?

The theory of climate change is very new. In fact, scientists don’t even call it a theory. But it meets the requirements.
These are the things we know: (1) average global temperatures are rising, (2) greenhouse gases trap heat in the
atmosphere, (3) CO2 is released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned, (4) CO2 is a greenhouse gas, (5)
more CO2 in the atmosphere traps more heat so global temperature is rising. No information contradicts this theory,
although some details have not been worked out. The theory is very effective at predicting future events, which are
already taking place. This idea will be explored in detail in the chapter Atmospheric Processes.

Laws

Many people think that any idea that is completely accepted in science is a law. But that is not true. In science, a law
is something that always applies under the same conditions. A law explains a fairly simple phenomenon. A theory
is much more complex: it tells you why something happens. A law only tells you that it happens. For example, if
you hold something above the ground and let go, it will fall. This phenomenon is recognized by the law of gravity (
Figure 1.9). Some people say that evolution is "just a theory." But for a complex explanation like evolution, theory
is the right word.

FIGURE 1.9
Skydiving is possible because of the law of gravity.

Summary

• A theory is an explanation of a complex phenomenon. A theory tells why something happens.
• A theory can be used to predict future events.
• A law describes something that always happens under the same set of circumstances. A law does not say why

it happens. But even laws do not always hold.

1.8 Scientiﬁc Models

• Describe a scientiﬁc model.
• Explain why scientists use models.
• Explain the importance and uses of scientiﬁc models.

Why do scientists need models?
Scientists work with models because reality is complex and difﬁcult. Earth’s climate is an example of a system
that is both difﬁcult and complex. Many factors inﬂuence climate: clouds, snow cover, ocean mixing, sequestration
of carbon in the oceans, etc. In fact, there are many more factors than can be dealt with all at once. Models are
necessary in science. However, you must always remember that a model is a model and not the real thing.

Models are Useful Tools

Scientiﬁc models are useful tools for scientists. Most of Earth’s systems are extremely complex. Models allow
scientists to work with systems that are nearly impossible to study as a whole. Models help scientists to understand
these systems. They can analyze and make predictions about them using the models. There are different types of
models.

• Physical models are smaller and simpler representations of the thing being studied. A globe or a map is a

physical model of a portion or all of Earth.

• Conceptual models tie together many ideas to explain a phenomenon or event.
• Mathematical models are sets of equations that take into account many factors to represent a phenomenon.

Mathematical models are usually done on computers.

Many models are created on computers ( Figure 1.10). Only computers can handle and manipulate such enormous
amounts of data. Many scientists now work with climate models. An unimaginable number of factors affect Earth’s

25

1.8. Scientiﬁc Models

www.ck12.org

climate. Many factors are dependent on one another. A reasonably accurate climate model needs the most powerful
computers. Still, no computer has yet been developed that can work with the entire system. So scientists create
models that represent parts of the system.

FIGURE 1.10
Many scientists use computers to model complicated processes.

Models Can be Used to Test Ideas

Scientists must test their ideas. It’s much easier to work with a model than with a whole system. A scientist may
want to understand how rising CO2 levels will affect climate. In this case, it will be easier to model a smaller portion
of that system. For example, the scientist may model how higher levels of CO2 affect plant growth and the effect
that will have on climate.

Models Can be Used to Make Predictions

Models can be used to predict the future. The best ones take into account the most factors. How do scientists know
if a model will predict the future accurately? One way is to use a time in the past as the starting point. Then run
the model to see if the model can accurately predict the present. A model that can successfully predict the present is
more likely to be better at predicting the future. For example, climate models are very useful for trying to determine
what types of changes we can expect as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises.

Models Have Limitations

Since models are simpler than real objects or systems, they have limitations. A model deals with only a portion of a
system. It may not predict the behavior of the real system very accurately. But the more computing power that goes
into the model and the care with which the scientists construct the model can increase the chances that a model will
be accurate.

Summary

• A model is a representation of a more complex system. Models can be manipulated more easily than the

system.

• Models can be used to make predictions.
• Models may be physical, conceptual, or mathematical.

1.9 Scientiﬁc Community

• Explain how the scientiﬁc community regulates itself.
• Explain how the scientiﬁc community supports research.
• Deﬁne peer review.
• Describe scientiﬁc integrity.

Can only a genius be a scientist?
Of course not! Scientists come from all backgrounds. They have many interests and talents. Scientists have many
different reasons for pursuing science. Most scientists are intelligent, creative and logical people. They are open to
new ideas but require evidence to accept them. Women and racial minorities are becoming scientists more than ever
before. Diversity brings in more ideas and more ways of solving problems. This makes science stronger.

Funding Science

Scientiﬁc research is expensive. So the scientiﬁc community controls the type of research that is done. They do
this by allotting money. Scientists must write a proposal to an agency or private organization. Two examples are
the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The scientists
outline their project and list what they need in equipment, supplies, and salaries. Scientiﬁc proposals are evaluated
by other scientists in that ﬁeld of science. In many ﬁelds, the funding rate is low. The money goes only to the most
worthy research projects. Once the scientists get the money, they can do their research.

Working Environment

Scientists may work in colleges and universities. They may work in research institutions or government agencies.
Businesses and industries hire scientists in a variety of ﬁelds. There are many opportunities for well-trained
scientists.
Scientists may work together on a project. One reason is that they can share equipment and personnel. Another
reason is that they can share ideas. Scientists may also work separately. Even then, they use each other’s data and
interpretations. When one scientist publishes a paper, others will replicate the work to make sure they get the same

28

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1. What is Science?

result. If they do, the work is valid. If they don’t, someone needs to ﬁnd the source of the problem. Scientists openly
communicate with each other on their results. They also discuss and sometimes disagree on their interpretations. If
scientists do disagree, they will look for evidence so that they may resolve the disagreement.

Sharing Results

A hypothesis will not be fully accepted unless it is supported by the work of many scientists. Although a study may
take place in a single laboratory, a scientist must present her work to the community of scientists in her ﬁeld.

FIGURE 1.11
Participants share their results at a scien-
tiﬁc conference.

The scientist may present her data and conclusions at a scientiﬁc conference ( Figure 1.11). She will talk with
many other scientists to see what they think of her work. Scientists will openly discuss and criticize the work. The
scientist may need to gather more data to resolve the problems. Later, she will write a paper to be published in a
scientiﬁc journal. Several scientists will review the paper. This process is called peer review. They will make sure
the researcher used scientiﬁc method. They will make sure her interpretations follow logically from the data. The
scientists may then recommend that she does further work. Or they may deny the paper for publication. Once the
paper is published, other scientists will use her results in their own work.
Scientiﬁc ideas are advanced after many papers on a topic are published.

The Outcomes of a Scientiﬁc Study

Sometimes a study will support an idea. This may bring the idea closer to acceptance in the scientiﬁc community.
Sometimes new methods or procedures may be developed for a study to be performed. This may assist other
scientists with their investigations. Any of these things may lead to new investigations and new data.

Scientiﬁc Integrity

The scientiﬁc community monitors scientiﬁc integrity. During their training, students learn how to conduct good
scientiﬁc experiments. They learn not to fake, hide, or selectively report data. They learn how to fairly evaluate data.
They learn how to interpret the work of other scientists. Scientists who do not have scientiﬁc integrity are strongly
condemned by the scientiﬁc community. Sometimes scientists are hired by private companies to do studies. Often
these scientists ﬁnd what the company wants them to ﬁnd. These studies should be evaluated very carefully before
the results are used. However, often the studies are taken seriously by the media. It is important to know who funded
the research to know how to evaluate the results of a study.

29

1.9. Scientiﬁc Community

www.ck12.org

Nothing is perfect, and science isn’t either. Still, considering all the scientiﬁc research that is done, there are few
incidences of scientiﬁc dishonesty. When they do occur, they are often reported with great vehemence by the media.
This may cause the public to mistrust scientists in ways that are unwarranted.

Summary

• If science is done well, other scientists who replicate the same work will get the same results.
• Scientists peer review a scientiﬁc paper before it is published. This is done to be sure the work was done using

the scientiﬁc method.

• There are lots of controls in science. Scientists communicate and replicate each other’s work. The scientiﬁc

community has control of the projects that get funded.

• The checks and balances assure that nearly all scientists operate with a great deal of integrity.

1.10 Branches of Earth Science

• List the major branches of Earth Science.
• Distinguish the major branches of Earth Science.

What is Earth science?
Earth scientists seek to understand the beautiful sphere on which we live. Earth is a very large, complex set of
systems. So most Earth scientists study one aspect of the planet. Researchers work together to answer complicated
questions. The major branches of Earth science are described below.

Geology

Geology is the study of the solid Earth. Geologists study how rocks and minerals form. The way mountains rise up
is part of geology. The way mountains erode away is another part. Geologists also study fossils and Earth’s history.
There are many other branches of geology. There is so much to know about our home planet that most geologists
become specialists in one area. For example, a mineralogist studies minerals ( Figure 1.12).
Some volcanologists brave molten lava to study volcanoes. Seismologists monitor earthquakes worldwide to help
protect people and property from harm ( Figure 1.12). Paleontologists are interested in fossils and how ancient
organisms lived. Scientists who compare the geology of other planets to Earth are planetary geologists. Some
geologists study the Moon. Others look for petroleum. Still others specialize in studying soil. Some geologists
can tell how old rocks are and determine how different rock layers formed. There is probably an expert in almost
anything you can think of related to Earth!

FIGURE 1.12
(left) Mineralogists focus on all kinds of
minerals. (right) Seismographs are used
to measure earthquakes and pinpoint
their origins.

Geologists might study rivers and lakes, the underground water found between soil and rock particles, or even water
that is frozen in glaciers. Earth scientists need geographers who explore the features of Earth’s surface. They work
with cartographers, who make maps. Studying the layers of rock beneath the surface helps us to understand the
history of planet Earth ( Figure 1.13).
Geologists ask a lot of questions. They wonder what they need to know about earthquakes to be able to predict them
in time to evacuate a region. They ask what will happen to shorelines as sea level rises. Some even wonder what
would happen if the magnetic ﬁeld reverses!

FIGURE 1.13
These folded rock layers have bent over
time. Studying rock layers helps scientists
to explain these layers and the geologic
history of the area.

Oceanography

Oceanography is the study of the oceans. The word oceanology might be more accurate, since “ology” is “the study
of.” “Graph” is “to write” and refers to mapmaking. But mapping the oceans is how oceanography started.
More than 70% of Earth’s surface is covered with water. Almost all of that water is in the oceans. Scientists have
visited the deepest parts of the ocean in submarines. Remote vehicles go where humans can’t ( Figure 1.14). Yet
much of the ocean remains unexplored. Some people call the ocean “the last frontier.”
There are many branches of oceanography. Physical oceanography is the study of water movement, like waves and

Chapter 1. What is Science?

FIGURE 1.14

ocean currents. Physical oceanographers ask when or if a tsunami will hit a shoreline. Marine geologists look at
rocks and structures in the ocean basins. These scientists ask how new ocean crust forms. Chemical oceanographers
study the natural elements in ocean water. Chemical oceanographers might be concerned with where carbon dioxide
goes in the oceans. Marine biologists look at marine life. There are lots of questions to ask about marine life!

Meteorology and Climatology

Meteorologists don’t study meteors—they study the atmosphere! The atmosphere is a thin layer of gas that surrounds
Earth. The word “meteor” refers to things in the air. Meteorology includes the study of weather patterns, clouds,
hurricanes, and tornadoes. Meteorology is very important. Using radars and satellites, meteorologists work to
predict, or forecast, the weather ( Figure 1.15). Meteorologists are getting better at predicting the weather all the
time. Meteorologists wonder how to better predict weather. They wonder what the effects of rising water vapor in
the atmosphere will be on weather.

Meteorologists forecast the weather a re-
gion can expect from a tropical storm.

1.10. Branches of Earth Science

www.ck12.org

Climatologists also study the atmosphere. These scientists work to understand the climate as it is now. They also
study how climate will change in response to global warming. There are lots of questions to ask about our changing
climate.

Environmental Science

Environmental scientists study the effects people have on their environment. This includes the landscape, atmo-
sphere, water, and living things. These scientists ask all sorts of questions about how Earth systems are changing as
a result of human actions. They try to predict what changes will come in the future.
Ecologists study lifeforms and the environments they live in ( Figure 1.16). They try to predict the chain reactions
that could occur when one part of the ecosystem is disrupted.

Astronomy

Astronomy is the study of outer space and the physical bodies beyond planet Earth. Astronomers use telescopes to
see things far beyond what the human eye can see. Astronomers help to design spacecrafts or satellites that travel
into space and send back information about faraway places ( Figure 1.17).

FIGURE 1.17
The Hubble Space Telescope.

Astronomers ask a wide variety of questions. How do strong bursts of energy from the Sun, called solar ﬂares, affect
communications? How might an impact from an asteroid affect life on Earth? What are the properties of black
holes? Astronomers ask bigger questions too. How was the Universe created? Is there life on other planets? Are
there resources on other planets that people could use for space travel? Astronomers use what Earth scientists know
about our planet to make comparisons with other planets.

1.11 Earth Science Field Work

• Deﬁne ﬁeld work.
• Explain the importance of ﬁeld trips in the study of Earth Science.

Do Earth scientists work in the ﬁeld?
Yes! Many geologists do ﬁeld work to better understand Earth. Many others go on ﬁeld trips to learn about certain
types of geology. In Glacier National Park, a geologist could learn about mountain building. They could learn about
how glaciers modify landscapes. He could take photos to assist him in teaching a class. He could just have a great
time in a geologically fascinating area!

Field Work

Many Earth scientists collect data in the ﬁeld, called ﬁeld work. The data may be from observations or measure-
ments. The scientists may create a geological map of the area. They might write detailed descriptions of the rocks
and their relationships. They may collect samples to analyze in the lab. They may do a combination of all of these!
Earth science laboratories contain high-tech equipment. That equipment can reveal the chemistry or age of a rock
sample. Geologists do ﬁeld work to look for resources. They may study a region for environmental cleanup. There
are many other reasons for going in the ﬁeld. One common reason is just to understand the region better.

Field Trips

To really understand geology and some of the other branches of Earth science, it’s best to go out in the ﬁeld! Geology
students in many colleges and universities go on a lot of ﬁeld trips. Some of the concepts presented in this text can
be illustrated by features seen in the ﬁeld. Where possible, photos are provided to illustrate concepts. So we can get
some of the beneﬁt of going on a ﬁeld trip! Some of the places that are featured in this text are described below.

In the satellite image above ( Figure 1.18), it is possible to identify the major geographic (physical) features of
California.

• The Coast Range runs the length of the state along the Paciﬁc coast. A tremendous amount of rain falls in the
northern part of the range, so the region is heavily forested. There is less rainfall and vegetation further south.
• The Central Valley is made up of the Sacramento and San Joaquin river valleys. The Central Valley runs
through about half of the central part of the state. The valley is located between the mountains of the Coast
Range and the Sierra Nevada. The Central Valley is one of the most important agricultural regions in the
world.

• The Sierra Nevada Mountain range lies east of the Central Valley. In the winter, the mountains are covered
by snow. In this image, there is little to no snow, and the bare rocks of the high peaks are showing. Yosemite
National Park lies within the Sierra Nevada.

• East of the Sierra Nevada and into the state of Nevada, the climate is very arid. Death Valley, the driest spot

in the United States, is found there.

• Mt. Shasta, at the north end of the Sierra Nevada, is the southernmost remaining volcanic cone in the Cascades

Range.

East of the image of California is Nevada. Very different from California, Nevada is extremely arid. The Basin and
Range province consists of a set of mountains and valleys. You can see the ranges as dark brown rocky regions and
the valleys as lighter brown.

Paciﬁc Northwest

FIGURE 1.19
North of California along the Paciﬁc Coast
is Oregon, Washington, and then British
Columbia in Canada. This region is simi-
lar to California in having a coastal range,
a central valley (at least in part of Ore-
gon), and very arid lands east of the high
Cascades mountains.

The Cascades are a chain of volcanoes that run through Oregon and Washington, and into British Columbia ( Figure
1.19). Some of them are easily spotted on this image as white spots in the midst of the green forests of the Cascades
Range.

Idaho, Montana, Wyoming

The states of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming are located east of the Paciﬁc Northwest. The landscape ranges from
mountainous forests to deserts ( Figure 1.20).

Glacier National Park in the northwestern part of Montana ( Figure 1.20) reaches to the Canadian border. Glacier
National Park ( Figure 1.21) was established in 1910 to preserve the wild lands and wildlife. But less precipitation

Yellowstone National Park ( Figure 1.23) is in the northwestern corner of Wyoming. Yellowstone is best known for
its incredible geysers. The park also has gorgeous mountain scenery and fantastic wildlife, including herds of bison
( Figure 1.24). The best known feature is Old Faithful. This geyser is not the highest, largest, or most beautiful, but
it is the most reliable.

Southwest

The Southwestern United States ( Figure 1.25) is a great place to study geology. The region is so arid that in
most locations rocks and structures are easily seen. In several concepts we will visit parts of the Southwest to view
geology in the ﬁeld.

Geologists say that the Grand Canyon ( Figure 1.26) has "layer cake geology." This is because the rock strata are in
layers. They are extremely easy to see. Sedimentary rocks are like a book that tells the story of the environment in
which they formed. Rock units can be traced across large expanses. Looking down into the Grand Canyon, you get
a sense of the vastness of space and of time.

Hawaiian Islands

eruptions at an underwater volcano called Loihi seamount. Loihi is the youngest volcano. Hawaii is a fantastic place
to see volcanic eruptions and features.

1.12 Principle of Uniformitarianism

• Explain how scientists use knowledge of Earth in the present to understand Earth’s history.
• Summarize the principle of uniformitarianism.

What does this mean: "The present is the key to the past"?
How can this photo help you to ﬁgure out what happened in Earth’s history? You see the molten lava. You see what
the rock looks like when the lava cools. What if you see that type of rock in an outcrop? You can assume that it
formed from molten lava. This is the best tool for understanding Earth history. Earth scientists use what they know
about Earth in the present to ﬁgure out what happened in the past.

Ask a Question: Earth History

The outcrop in the Figure 1.28 is at Checkerboard Mesa in Zion National Park, Utah. It has a very interesting pattern
on it. As a geology student you may ask: how did this rock form?
If you look carefully at the rock, you will see that it’s made of sand. This rock formation is called the Navajo
sandstone. Does knowing that the rock is sandstone tell you how it formed? No, although it limits the possibilities.
The next thing to do is to make observations now and apply them to this rock that formed long ago.

Uniformitarianism

James Hutton came up with this idea in the late 1700s. The present is the key to the past. He called this the principle
of uniformitarianism. It works like this: we understand a geological process that happens now. We see the outcome
of that process, say a rock. Then we ﬁnd evidence that same process happened in the past, like a similar rock. We
can assume that the process operated the same way in the past.
Let’s go back to that outcrop. What would cause sandstone to have layers that cross each other, a feature called
cross-bedding?

45

FIGURE 1.28
Checkerboard Mesa in Zion National
Park, Utah.

Answer a Question: Earth History

In this photo of this sand dune in Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park, Utah ( Figure 1.29), we see that wind can cause
cross-bedding in sand. Cross-bedding is due to changes in wind direction. There are also ripples caused by the wind
waving over the surface of the dune.
This doesn’t look exactly like the outcrop of Navajo sandstone, but if you could cut a cross-section into the face of
the dune it would look very similar.
Since we can observe wind forming sand dunes with these patterns now, we have a good explanation for how the
Navajo sandstone formed. The Navajo sandstone is a rock formed from ancient sand dunes. The rock shows that the
ancient wind direction changed from time to time.
This is just one example of how geologists use observations they make today to unravel what happened in Earth’s
past. Rocks formed from volcanoes, oceans, rivers, and many other features are deciphered by looking at the
geological work those features do today.

Summary

• You may need to apply what you know about the present to determine what happened in the past.
• The idea that the present is the key to the past was recognized by James Hutton in the late 1700s.
• If you see something forming by a process today and then ﬁnd the end results of that process in the rock

record, you can assume that the the process operated the same way in the past.

1.13 Location on the Earth

• Identify and deﬁne latitude and longitude.
• Deﬁne the Prime Meridian.
• Understand how coordinates are used on a map.
• Summarize Global Positioning Systems.

How could you locate this feature?
Geologists, hikers, and many other people need to be able to say where they are. Or where they want to go. They
need to be able to mark a location on a map. The opening photo is of Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National
Park. It is located at 44°30’N and 110°150’W. Let’s explore what that means.

Location

To describe your location, you could use a coordinate system. To do this you need two points. For example, you
could use streets. Maybe you are at the corner of Maple Avenue and Main Street. Or you could use a point of
reference, a distance and an angle for direction. If you want to meet up with a friend, you could tell him “I am two
blocks due north of your apartment.” Can you identify the point of reference, the distance, and the angle?

Map Coordinates

Most maps use a grid of lines to help you to ﬁnd your location. This grid system is called a geographic coordinate
system. Using this system you can deﬁne your location by two numbers, latitude and longitude. Both numbers are
angles between your location, the center of Earth, and a reference line ( Figure 1.30).

FIGURE 1.30
Lines of latitude start with the Equator.
Lines of
the prime

longitude begin at

Latitude

Lines of latitude circle around Earth. The Equator is a line of latitude right in the middle of the planet. Latitude
is divided into degrees: 90° north of the Equator and 90° south of the Equator. One degree is subdivided into 60
minutes. One minute is subdivided into 60 seconds. The Equator is at 0°. The Equator is an equal distance from
both the North and South Poles. If you know your latitude, you know how far you are north or south of the Equator.

Longitude

Lines of longitude are circles that go around Earth from pole to pole, like the sections of an orange. Longitude
is also measured in degrees, which are subdivided into minutes and seconds. Lines of longitude start at the Prime
Meridian, which is 0°. The Prime Meridian is a circle that runs north to south and passes through Greenwich,
England. Longitude tells you how far you are east or west from the Prime Meridian ( Figure 1.31). On the opposite
side of the planet from the Prime Meridian is the International Date Line. It is at 180°. This is the place where a new
day ﬁrst arrives.
You can remember latitude and longitude by doing jumping jacks. When your hands are above your head and your
feet are together, say longitude (your body is long!). When you put your arms out to the side horizontally, say
latitude (your head and arms make a cross, like the “t” in latitude). While you are jumping, your arms are going the
same way as each of these grid lines: horizontal for latitude and vertical for longitude.

Using Latitude and Longitude on a Map

If you know the latitude and longitude of a place, you can ﬁnd it on a map. Simply place one ﬁnger on the latitude
on the vertical axis of the map. Place your other ﬁnger on the longitude along the horizontal axis of the map. Move
your ﬁngers along the latitude and longitude lines until they meet. For example, say the location you want to ﬁnd is
at 30°N and 90°W. Place your right ﬁnger along 30°N at the right of the map. Place your left ﬁnger along the bottom

at 90°W. Move your ﬁngers along the lines until they meet. Your location should be near New Orleans, Louisiana,
along the Gulf coast of the United States. Now can you locate Old Faithful, 44°30’N and 110°150’W, on a map?
What if you want to know the latitude and longitude of your location? If you know where you are on a map, point
to the place with your ﬁngers. Take one ﬁnger and move it along the latitude line to ﬁnd your latitude. Then move
another ﬁnger along the longitude line to ﬁnd your longitude.

Global Positioning System

In order to get latitude, longitude, and elevation you need several instruments. What if you could do the same thing
with only one instrument? A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver is all that is needed to locate your position
on the Earth’s surface in many places.
By 1993, the United States military had launched 24 satellites to help soldiers locate their positions on battleﬁelds.
This system of satellites was called the Global Positioning System (GPS). Later, the United States government
allowed the public to use this system. Here’s how it works.
You must have a GPS receiver to use the system. You can buy many types of these in stores. The GPS receiver
detects radio signals from nearby GPS satellites. There are precise clocks on each satellite and in the receiver. The
receiver measures the time for radio signals from satellites to reach it. The receiver uses the time and the speed of
radio signals to calculate the distance between the receiver and the satellite. The receiver does this with at least four
different satellites to locate its position on the Earth’s surface ( Figure 1.32). GPS receivers are now being built into
many items, such as cell phones and cars.
You can use a GPS meter to tell you how to get to Old Faithful.

Summary

• Latitude is the distance north or south of the Equator. It is expressed as a number between 0° and 90° north or

south.

• Longitude is the distance east or west of the Prime Meridian. It is expressed as a number between 0° and 180°

east or west.

• The global positioning system uses satellites to display very accurate location information on a special re-

ceiver.

1.14 Direction on the Earth

• Learn how to use a compass.
• Describe a polar coordinate system.

How do you indicate which way the wind blows?
When an object is moving, it is not enough to describe its location. We also need to know direction. For example, a
wind blows a storm over your school. Where is that storm coming from? Where is it going? Direction is also needed
to indicate where two points are relative to each other on a map.

Direction

To connect two points accurately you need a direction. This occurs when you need to go from point A to point B. It
also happens if you want to describe where something is going. If you are walking across a ﬁeld, for example, you
might say you’re going north 20° east.

Compass

The most common way to ﬁnd direction is by using a compass. A compass is a device with a ﬂoating needle (
Figure 1.33). The needle is a small magnet that aligns itself with the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. The compass needle
always points to magnetic north. If you have a compass and you ﬁnd north, you can then know any other direction.
See the directions, such as east, south, west, etc., on a compass rose.
A compass needle lines up with Earth’s magnetic north pole. This is different from Earth’s geographic north pole,
also called true north. The geographic north pole is the top of an imaginary line. This line is the axis around which

FIGURE 1.33
(a) A compass is a device that is used to
determine direction. The needle points to
Earth’s magnetic north pole. (b) A com-
pass rose shows the four major directions,
plus intermediates between them.

Earth rotates. The geographic north pole is much like the spindle of a spinning top. The location of the geographic
north pole does not change. However, the magnetic north pole shifts in location over time. Depending on where you
live, you can correct for the difference between the two poles when you use a map and a compass ( Figure 1.34).

FIGURE 1.34
Earth’s magnetic north pole is about 11 degrees offset from its geographic
north pole.

Some maps have a double compass rose. This allows users to make the corrections between magnetic north and true
north. An example is a nautical chart that boaters use to chart their positions at sea ( Figure 1.35).

Polar Coordinate System

You can also use a polar coordinate system. Your location is marked by an angle and distance from some reference
point. The angle is usually the angle between your location, the reference point, and a line pointing north. The
distance is given in meters or kilometers. To ﬁnd your location or to move from place to place, you need a map, a
compass, and some way to measure your distance, such as a range ﬁnder.
Suppose you need to go from your location to a marker that is 20°E and 500 m from your current position. You must
do the following:

• Use the compass and compass rose on the map to orient your map with north.
• Use the compass to ﬁnd which direction is 20°E.
• Walk 500 meters in that direction to reach your destination.
• Polar coordinates are used in a sport called orienteering. People who do orienteering use a compass and a map
with polar coordinates. Participants ﬁnd their way along a course across wilderness terrain ( Figure 1.36).
They move to various checkpoints along the course. The winner is the person who completes the course in the
fastest time.

Summary

• Direction is expressed as north, south, east, or west, or some gradation between them.
• A compass can be used to indicate direction. A compass rose shows direction on a map or chart.
• To ﬁnd your location or to move from place to place, you need a map, a compass, and some way to measure

your distance.

1.15 Elevation on the Earth

• Deﬁne elevation.
• Understand topography.

Where are you in the third dimension?
Mt. Sheridan in Yellowstone National Park is higher above sea level than most locations. It is at 10,250 ft (3,124
m). When you’re up at that elevation, you deﬁnitely think about the third dimension. It is, of course, elevation, or
height above sea level. You can see Mt. Sheridan in the opening image and on the map.

Elevation

As you know, the surface of Earth is not ﬂat. Some places are high, and some places are low. For example, mountain
ranges like the Sierra Nevada in California or the Andes in South America are high above the surrounding areas. An
accurate location must take into account the third dimension. Elevation is the height above or below sea level. Sea
level refers to the height of the ocean’s surface. This is the midpoint between high and low tide. Sea level can vary
from place to place, but scientists base their elevation measurements on the average, or mean, sea level to make sure
they have a standard reference point.

Topography

We can describe the topography of a region by measuring the height or depth of that feature relative to sea level
( Figure 1.37). You might measure your height relative to your classmates. When your class lines up, some kids
make high “mountains,” while others are more like small hills!
Relief, or terrain, includes all the landforms of a region. For example, the image below shows the San Francisco
Peaks in northern Arizona ( Figure 1.38). Features on the map include mountains, hills, and lava ﬂows. You can
recognize these features from the differences in elevation.

Summary

• Elevation refers to height above average sea level.
• The topography of a region describes its highs and lows.
• Sea level is the midpoint between high and low tide. It can vary around Earth.

1.16 Maps

• Identify and deﬁne types of maps common in Earth science.
• Use maps to ﬁnd information about a location.

What information does a map show?
Maps can convey a lot of different types of information. They can tell you where you are, or they can tell you
something about a location. Maps can display the relief of an area. They can indicate something about the society
that lives in the area. Different types of maps show many different types of things.

Maps as Models

Imagine you are going on a road trip. Perhaps you are going on vacation. How do you know where to go? Most
likely, you will use a map. A map is a picture of speciﬁc parts of Earth’s surface. There are many types of maps.
Each map gives us different information. Let’s look at a road map, which is the probably the most common map that
you use ( Figure 1.39).

Map Legends

You can see the following on this road map of Florida ( Figure 1.39):

• The boundaries of the state show its shape.
• Black dots represent the cities. Each city is named. The size of the dot represents the population of the city.
• Red and brown lines show major roads that connect the cities.
• Blue lines show rivers. Their names are written in blue.

FIGURE 1.39
A road map of the state of Florida. What information can you get from this map?

• Blue areas show lakes and other waterways: the Gulf of Mexico, Biscayne Bay, and Lake Okeechobee. Names

for bodies of water are also written in blue.

• A line or scale of miles shows the distance represented on the map; an inch or centimeter on the map represents

a certain amount of distance (miles or kilometers).

• Look for the legend on the top left side of the map. The legend explains other features and symbols on the

map.

• It is the convention for north to be at the top of a map. For this reason, a compass rose is not needed on most

maps.

You can use this map to ﬁnd your way around Florida and get from one place to another along roadways.

Types of Maps

There are many other types of maps other than road maps. Some examples include:

• Political or geographic maps show the outlines and borders of states and/or countries.

61

1.16. Maps

www.ck12.org

• Satellite view maps show terrains and vegetation: forests, deserts, and mountains.
• Relief maps show elevations of areas. They are usually on a larger scale, such as the whole Earth, rather than

a local area.

• Topographic maps show detailed elevations of features on the map.
• Climate maps show average temperatures and rainfall.
• Precipitation maps show the amount of rainfall in different areas.
• Weather maps show storms, air masses, and fronts.
• Radar maps show storms and rainfall.
• Geologic maps detail the types and locations of rocks found in an area.

These are but a few types of maps that various Earth scientists might use. You can easily carry a map around in
your pocket or bag. Maps are easy to use, because they are ﬂat or two-dimensional. However, the world is three-
dimensional. So, how do mapmakers represent a three-dimensional world on ﬂat paper?

Summary

• Maps are two-dimensional representations of a surface, usually Earth’s.
• Maps use symbols and have legends. This is so they can display the most amount of information in the least

amount of space.

• There are many types of maps. They can show social and political information; they can show scientiﬁc

information.

1.17 Map Projections

• Identify and deﬁne types of map projections.
• Describe a Mercator projection.

How does Greenland change size?
Greenland does not change size! Different map projections make Greenland appear to be a different size. The
Mercator projection makes everything that is near the polar areas appear too large. The Mollweide projection distorts
the size of the polar regions much less. To see the actual size of Greenland, look at a globe.

Map Projections

Earth is a round, three-dimensional ball. In a small area, Earth looks ﬂat, so it is not hard to make accurate maps of
a small place. When mapmakers want to map the round Earth on ﬂat paper, they use projections. What happens if
you try to ﬂatten out the skin of a peeled orange? Or if you try to gift wrap a soccer ball? To ﬂatten out, the orange
peel must rip, and its shape must become distorted. To wrap a round object with ﬂat paper requires lots of extra cuts
and folds. A projection is a way to represent Earth’s curved surface on ﬂat paper ( Figure 1.40).

FIGURE 1.40
A map projection translates Earth’s
curved surface onto two dimensions.

There are many types of projections. Each uses a different way to change three dimensions into two dimensions.
There are two basic methods that the mapmaker uses in projections:

63

1.17. Map Projections

www.ck12.org

• The mapmaker “slices” the sphere in some way and unfolds it to make a ﬂat map. This is like ﬂattening out

an orange peel.

• The mapmaker can look at the sphere from a certain point and then translate this view onto a ﬂat paper.

Let’s look at a few commonly used projections.

Mercator Projection

In 1569, Gerardus Mercator (1512-1594) ( Figure 1.41) ﬁgured out a way to make a ﬂat map of our round world.
This is called the Mercator projection.
Imagine wrapping the round, ball-shaped Earth with a big, ﬂat piece of paper. First you make a tube or a cylinder.
The cylinder touches Earth at the Equator. The poles are the farthest points from the cylinder. Now shine a light
from the inside of your model Earth out to the cylinder. The image projected onto the paper is a Mercator projection.
Where does the projection represent Earth best? Where is it worst? Your map would be most correct at the Equator.
The shapes and sizes of continents become more stretched out near the poles. Early sailors and navigators found
the Mercator map useful because most explorations were located near the Equator. Many world maps still use the
Mercator projection.

FIGURE 1.41
A Mercator projection translates the
curved surface of Earth onto a cylinder.

The Mercator projection is best within 15° north or south of the Equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone
get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the Equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For
example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. But look at
the Mercator projection above. Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the
pole, the continent’s shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions. Why is
this true?
In a Mercator projection, all compass directions are straight lines. This makes it a good type of map for navigation.
The top of the map is north, the bottom is south, the left side is west and the right side is east. However, because
it is a ﬂat map of a curved surface, a straight line on the map is not the shortest distance between the two points it
connects.

Conic Projection

Instead of a cylinder, you could wrap the ﬂat paper into a cone. Conic map projections use a cone shape to better
represent regions near the poles ( Figure 1.42). Conic projections are best where the cone shape touches the globe.
This is along a line of latitude, usually the Equator.

64

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1. What is Science?

FIGURE 1.42
A conic map projection wraps Earth with
a cone shape rather than a cylinder.

Gnomonic Projection

What if you want a different approach? Let’s say you don’t want to wrap a ﬂat piece of paper around a round object.
You could put a ﬂat piece of paper right on the area that you want to map. This type of map is called a gnomonic
map projection ( Figure 1.43). The paper only touches Earth at one point. The sizes and shapes of countries near
that point are good. The poles are often mapped this way to avoid distortion. A gnomic projection is best for use
over a small area.

FIGURE 1.43
A gnomonic projection places a ﬂat piece
of paper on a point somewhere on Earth
and projects an image from that point.

Robinson Projection

In 1963, Arthur Robinson made a map with more accurate sizes and shapes of land areas. He did this using
mathematical formulas. The formulas could directly translate coordinates onto the map. This type of projection
is shaped like an oval rather than a rectangle ( Figure 1.44).
Robinson’s map is more accurate than a Mercator projection. The shapes and sizes of continents are closer to true.
Robinson’s map is best within 45° of the Equator. Distances along the Equator and the lines parallel to it are true.
However, the scales along each line of latitude are different. In 1988, the National Geographic Society began to use
Robinson’s projection for its world maps.

Summary

• A map projection is a way to show a three-dimensional ﬁgure in two dimensions.

• All map projections have some distortion. Different types have distortions in different locations and of

different amounts.

• Robinson’s project is different from the rest because it uses mathematical formulas. Other projections are best

at one point.

1.18 Topographic and Geologic Maps

• Deﬁne topographic map and contour line.
• List the rules of topographic maps.
• Understand contour maps.
• Explain a geologic map.

Can a map help you understand a place even if you’ve never been there?
Hills, streams, valleys, and snowﬁelds all show up on some types of maps. With practice, people can look at a
topographic map and see what the landscape is really like. Of course, it’s not the same as being there! But a
topographic map can give you a good feel for an area before you go. It can also help you to identify features once
you are there. What does this map tell you about the region? Can you identify features that appear in the photo on
the map?

67

1.18. Topographic and Geologic Maps

www.ck12.org

Topographic Maps

The topography of a region can be shown on a map. Topographic maps represent geographical features, such as
hills and valleys. Topographic maps use contour lines to show geographical features. A contour line is a line of
equal elevation. If you walk along a contour line, you will not go uphill or downhill. Topographic maps are also
called contour maps. The rules of topographic maps are:

• Each line connects all points of a speciﬁc elevation.
• Contour lines never cross. After all, a single point can only have one elevation.
• Every ﬁfth contour line is bolded and labeled.
• Adjacent contour lines are separated by a constant difference in elevation (such as 20 feet or 100 feet). The

difference in elevation is the contour interval. The contour interval is indicated in the map legend.

• Scales indicate horizontal distance and are also found on the map legend.

Interpreting Contour Maps

How does a topographic map tell you about the terrain? Let’s consider the following principles:
1. The spacing of contour lines shows the slope of the land. Contour lines that are close together indicate a steep
slope. This is because the elevation changes quickly in a small area. Contour lines that seem to touch indicate a very
steep slope, like a cliff. When contour lines are spaced far apart, the slope is gentle. So contour lines help us see the
three-dimensional shape of the land.
Look at the topographic map of Stowe, Vermont ( Figure 1.45). There is a steep hill rising just to the right of the
city of Stowe. You can tell this because the contour lines there are closely spaced. The contour lines also show that
the hill has a sharp rise of about 200 feet. Then the slope becomes less steep toward the right.

FIGURE 1.45
Portion of a USGS topographic map of
Stowe, VT.

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1. What is Science?

2. Concentric circles indicate a hill. Pictured below is another side of the topographic map of Stowe, Vermont (
Figure 1.46). When contour lines form closed loops, there is a hill. The smallest loops are the higher elevations on
the hill. The larger loops encircling the smaller loops are downhill. If you look at the map, you can see Cady Hill in
the lower left and another, smaller hill in the upper right.

FIGURE 1.46
Portion of a USGS topographic map of Stowe, VT. Cady Hill (elevation
1122 feet) is shown by concentric circles in the lower left portion of the
map. Another hill (elevation ~ 960 feet) is on the upper right portion of the
map.

3. Hatched concentric circles indicate a depression. The hatch marks are short, perpendicular lines inside the
circle. The innermost hatched circle represents the deepest part of the depression ( Figure 1.47). The outer hatched
circles represent higher elevations.

FIGURE 1.47
On a contour map, a circle with inward
hatches indicates a depression.

4. V-shaped portions of contour lines indicate stream valleys. The “V“ shape of the contour lines point uphill.
There is a V shape because the stream channel passes through the point of the V. The open end of the V represents
the downstream portion. A blue line indicates that there is water running through the valley. If there is not a blue
line, the V pattern indicates which way water ﬂows. Below, you can see examples of V-shaped markings ( Figure
1.48). Try to ﬁnd the direction a stream ﬂows.
5. Like other maps, topographic maps have a scale so that you can ﬁnd the horizontal distance. You can use
the horizontal scale to calculate the slope of the land (vertical height/horizontal distance). Common scales used in
United States Geological Service (USGS) maps include the following:

• 1:24,000 scale –1 inch = 2000 feet
• 1:100,000 scale –1 inch = 1.6 miles
• 1:250,000 scale –1 inch = 4 miles

Including contour lines, contour intervals, circles, and V-shapes allows a topographic map to show three-dimensional
information on a ﬂat piece of paper. A topographic map gives us a good idea of the shape of the land.

sponding topographic map (bottom). Note that the V-shaped markings on
the topographic maps correspond to drainage channels. Also, the closely-
spaced contour lines denote the rapid rising cliff face on the left side.

Geologic Maps

A geologic map shows the different rocks that are exposed at the surface of a region. The geology is often put on
a contour map. Rock units are shown in a color identiﬁed in a key. On the geologic map of the Grand Canyon,
for example, different rock types are shown in different colors. Some people call the Grand Canyon “layer cake
geology“ because most of the rock units are in layers. Rock units show up on both sides of a stream valley.
A geologic map looks very complicated in a region where rock layers have been folded. Faults are seen on this
geologic map cutting across rock layers. When rock layers are tilted, you will see stripes of each layer on the map.
There are symbols on a geologic map that tell you which direction the rock layers slant. Often there is a cut away
diagram, called a cross section. A cross section shows what the rock layers look like below the surface. A large-scale
geologic map will just show geologic provinces. They do not show the detail of individual rock layers.

1.19 Seaﬂoor

• Explain bathymetric maps.
• Describe ways scientists learn about the deep ocean.

Is it true that we know more about the dark side of the Moon than we do about the oceans?
It’s true! Why do you think so? The oceans are deep, dark, and frigid. All but the very top surface is under
extraordinarily high pressure. It’s hard to imagine an environment that’s less hospitable to human life! Yet, as you
will see, we know quite a bit about the oceans. This is due mostly to technology. Rovers, like the one pictured above,
allow scientists to remotely visit places that are too inhospitable for human life.

Studying the Seaﬂoor

Scuba divers can only dive to about 40 meters. When they dive deep, they cannot stay down for very long. Therefore,
scuba divers can only observe the organisms and ecosystems very near a coast. Most oceanic research requires
accessing greater depths.

Seaﬂoor Bathymetry

How do scientists create bathymetric maps? Early explorers mapped the seaﬂoor by painstakingly dropping a line
over the side of a ship. They measured the length of the line when it touched bottom. With this method, they could
measure the depth, one tiny spot at a time. During World War II, battleships and submarines carried echo sounders.
Echo sounders were developed to locate enemy submarines. Early echo sounders had a single beam. The beam
bounced off the nearest object and then returned to the ship. Scientists know the speed of sound in seawater. They
can then calculate the distance to the object based on the time it takes for the wave to make a round trip. This allowed
them to create a line of depth measurements. Modern echo sounders produce sound waves that travel outward in all
directions ( Figure 1.50).

72

www.ck12.org

Chapter 1. What is Science?

FIGURE 1.50
This echo sounder has many beams and creates a three dimensional map
of the seaﬂoor.

Bathymetric Maps

Topographic maps that show water depths are called bathymetric maps. An example of one is pictured below
( Figure 1.51). Bathymetric maps are made of any water body, including lakes and oceans. On these maps, the
contour lines represent depth below the surface. Therefore, high numbers are deeper depths and low numbers are
shallow depths.
Bathymetric maps are made from depth soundings or sonar data. They help oceanographers understand the shape of
bottoms of lakes, bays, and the ocean. This information also helps boaters navigate safely.

FIGURE 1.51
Bathymetric map of Bear Lake, Utah.

1.19. Seaﬂoor

Water Sampling

www.ck12.org

Scientists need to sample seawater (or lake water) from different depths. To sample seawater, bottles are placed
along a cable at regular depths ( Figure 1.52). When they are in position, a weight is dropped down the cable.
This closes the bottles. The water trapped in the bottle can be analyzed in a laboratory. This allows scientists to
understand ocean or lake chemistry.

FIGURE 1.52
A Niskin bottle being deployed off the side of a research ship.

Scientists also collect rock and sediment samples from the seaﬂoor. A dredge is a giant rectangular bucket that is
dragged along behind a ship. The dredge picks up loose rocks lying on the seaﬂoor. Gravity corers are metal tubes
that fall to the seaﬂoor. They slice into the sediments to collect a sample. The research vessel, the Joides Resolution,
drills deep into the seaﬂoor to collect samples of the sediment and ocean crust. Scientists analyze the samples for
chemistry and their magnetic properties.

Submersibles

Samples of seawater and rocks can be collected directly by scientists in a submersible. These subs can take scientists
down to make observations. The subs have arms for collecting samples. The human operated vehicle, Alvin can
dive up to 4,500 meters beneath the ocean surface and has made more than 4,600 dives since 1964 ( Figure 1.53).

FIGURE 1.53
Alvin allows two people and a pilot to make a nine hour dive.

Remotely Operated Vehicles

Chapter 1. What is Science?

Sending humans to the seaﬂoor is expensive and dangerous. Having to return humans safely to the surface limits
what a mission can do. Remotely operated vehicles, or ROVs, allow scientists to study the deep without going
to the seaﬂoor. These small vehicles carry cameras and scientiﬁc instruments. ROVs were used to study inside the
Titanic. This would have been far too dangerous for a manned sub to enter. Scientists control ROVs electronically
with sophisticated operating systems.
Footage of the NOAA Titanic Expedition of 2004 is visible in this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z7RE
EnwKOQ .

Summary

• Scientists have developed amazing technologies so that they can understand the oceans.
• Echo sounders use sound waves to make bathymetric maps of water bodies.
• Submersibles and ROVs allow scientists to view otherwise inhospitable regions.

1.20 Study of Space by the Electromagnetic

Spectrum

• Describe electromagnetic waves and the electromagnetic spectrum.
• Explain how astronomers use radiation to tell them about the Universe.

How do scientists learn about space?
Many scientists can touch the materials they study. Most can do experiments to test those materials. Biologists can
collect cells, seeds, or sea urchins to study in the laboratory. Physicists can test the strength of metal or smash atoms
into each other. Geologists can chip away at rocks and test their chemistry. What can astronomers use to study
space? Light and other electromagnetic waves, of course. This is the Andromeda Galaxy as it appeared 2.5 million
years ago. Why is the light so old?

Electromagnetic Spectrum

Earth is just a tiny speck in the Universe. Our planet is surrounded by lots of space. Light travels across empty
space. Light is the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Astronomers use the light and other energy that
comes to us to gather information about the Universe.

The Speed of Light

Chapter 1. What is Science?

In space, light travels at about 300,000,000 meters per second (670,000,000 miles per hour). How fast is that? A
beam of light could travel from New York to Los Angeles and back again nearly 40 times in just one second. Even
at that amazing rate, objects in space are so far away that it takes a lot of time for their light to reach us. Even light
from the nearest star, our sun, takes about eight minutes to reach Earth.

Light-Years

We need a really big unit to measure distances out in space because distances between stars are so great. A light-
year, 9.5 trillion kilometers (5.9 trillion miles), is the distance that light travels in one year. That’s a long way! Out
in space, it’s actually a pretty short distance.
Proxima Centauri is the closest star to us after the Sun. This near neighbor is 4.22 light-years away. That means
the light from Proxima Centauri takes 4.22 years to reach us. Our galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy, is about 100,000
light-years across. So it takes light 100,000 years to travel from one side of the galaxy to the other! It turns out that
even 100,000 light-years is a short distance. The most distant galaxies we have detected are more than 13 billion
light-years away. That’s over a hundred-billion-trillion kilometers!

Looking Back in Time

When we look at stars and galaxies, we are seeing over great distances. More importantly, we are also seeing back in
time. When we see a distant galaxy, we are actually seeing how the galaxy used to look. For example, the Whirlpool
Galaxy is about 23 million light-years from Earth ( Figure 1.54). When you see an image of the galaxy what are
you seeing? You are seeing the galaxy as it was 23 million years ago!

FIGURE 1.54
The Whirlpool Galaxy as it looked 23 million years ago.

Since scientists can look back in time, they can better understand the Universe’s history. Check out http://science.n
asa.gov/headlines/y2002/08feb_gravlens.htm to see how this is true.

Electromagnetic Waves

Light is one type of electromagnetic radiation. Light is energy that travels in the form of an electromagnetic wave.
Pictured below is a diagram of an electromagnetic wave ( Figure 1.55). An electromagnetic (EM) wave has two
parts: an electric ﬁeld and a magnetic ﬁeld. The electric and magnetic ﬁelds vibrate up and down, which makes the
wave.

77

1.20. Study of Space by the Electromagnetic Spectrum

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 1.55
An electromagnetic wave has oscillating
electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

The wavelength is the horizontal distance between two of the same points on the wave, like wave crest to wave
crest. A wave’s frequency measures the number of wavelengths that pass a given point every second. As wavelength
increases, frequency decreases. This means that as wavelengths get shorter, more waves move past a particular spot
in the same amount of time.

The Electromagnetic Spectrum

Visible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum ( Figure 1.56) that humans can see. Visible light includes all
the colors of the rainbow. Each color is determined by its wavelength. Visible light ranges from violet wavelengths
of 400 nanometers (nm) through red at 700 nm.
Visible light is only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum. There are parts of the electromagnetic spectrum
that humans cannot see. This radiation exists all around you. You just can’t see it! Every star, including our Sun,
emits radiation of many wavelengths. Astronomers can learn a lot from studying the details of the spectrum of
radiation from a star.

FIGURE 1.56
The electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays.

Many extremely interesting objects can’t be seen with the unaided eye. Astronomers use telescopes to see objects
at wavelengths all across the electromagnetic spectrum. Some very hot stars emit light primarily at ultraviolet
wavelengths. There are extremely hot objects that emit X-rays and even gamma rays. Some very cool stars shine
mostly in the infrared light wavelengths. Radio waves come from the faintest, most distant objects.

Summary

Chapter 1. What is Science?

• Electromagnetic radiation is energy transmitted as waves with different wavelengths. This makes up the

electromagnetic spectrum.

• Light travels very fast but still takes a long time to get across space. A light-year is the distance light can travel

in one year.

• From longest wavelengths to shortest wavelengths the electromagnetic spectrum is: radio waves, microwaves,

infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.

1.21 Telescopes

• Describe different types of telescopes.
• Distinguish radio telescopes from space telescopes.
• Explain how scientists use telescopes to understand space.

What would Galileo think of the things we can see through a telescope?
Galileo’s telescopes could see about as much as a regular pair of binoculars today. Galileo could see four moons
of Jupiter. This was four more than could be seen with the naked eye. But we now know that there are 66 moons.
Galileo would be astonished to see all of Jupiter’s moons. And imagine what he would think of the galaxies!

Types of Telescopes

Humans have been making and using magnifying lenses for thousands of years. The term "telescope" was coined
by the Italian scientist and mathematician Galileo Galilei (1564–1642). Galileo built the ﬁrst telescope in 1608.
His telescope used two lenses to make distant objects appear both nearer and larger. He subsequently made many
improvements to telescope design.

Optical Telescopes

Telescopes that use lenses to bend light are called refracting telescopes, or refractors ( Figure 1.57). The earliest
telescopes were all refractors. Many amateur astronomers still use refractors today. Refractors are good for viewing
details within our solar system. Craters on the surface of Earth’s Moon or the rings around Saturn are two such
details.
Around 1670, Sir Isaac Newton built a different kind of telescope. Newton’s telescope used curved mirrors instead
of lenses to focus light. This type of telescope is called a reﬂecting telescope, or reﬂector.
It’s much easier to precisely make mirrors than to precisely make glass lenses. Mirrors are also much lighter than
heavy glass lenses. For these two reasons, mirrors can be made larger than lenses. This is important because a

FIGURE 1.57
Refracting telescopes can be very large.

reﬂecting telescope can be made much larger. Larger telescopes can collect more light. This means that they can
study dimmer or more distant objects. The largest optical telescopes in the world today are reﬂectors. Telescopes
also can be made to use both lenses and mirrors.
For more on how telescopes were developed, visit http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html .

Radio Telescopes

Radio telescopes collect radio waves. These telescopes are even larger telescopes than reﬂectors. Radio telescopes
look a lot like satellite dishes. In fact, both are designed to collect and focus radio waves or microwaves from space.
The largest single radio telescope in the world is at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico ( Figure 1.58). This
telescope is located in a natural hole in the ground. This telescope would collapse under its own weight if it were
not supported by the ground. There is a big disadvantage to this design. What do you think it is? The telescope can
only observe the part of the sky that happens to be overhead at a given time.

FIGURE 1.58
The radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.

A group of radio telescopes can be linked together with a computer. The telescopes observe the same object. The
computer then combines the data from each telescope. This makes the group function like one single telescope. An
example is pictured below ( Figure 1.59).

FIGURE 1.59
The Very Large Array in New Mexico consists of 27 radio telescopes.

Space Telescopes

Telescopes on Earth all have one big problem: incoming light must pass through the atmosphere. This blocks some
wavelengths of radiation. Also, motion in the atmosphere distorts light. You see this when you see stars twinkling
in the night sky. Many observatories are built on high mountains. There is less air above the telescope, so there is
less interference from the atmosphere. Space telescopes avoid problems from the atmosphere completely since they
orbit outside the atmosphere.
The Hubble Space Telescope ( Figure 1.60) is the best known space telescope. Hubble began operations in 1994.
Since then, it has provided huge amounts of data. The telescope has helped astronomers answer many of the biggest
questions in astronomy.

FIGURE 1.60
The Hubble Space Telescope has opened up the Universe to human
observation.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has placed three other major space telescopes in orbit.
Each uses a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The James Webb Space Telescope will launch in 2018.
The telescope will replace the aging Hubble.

FIGURE 1.61
Stars in the star cluster appear as points of light. Observations like these
must be made with a space telescope.

Summary

• Refracting and reﬂecting telescopes are optical telescopes that use lenses to gather light.
• Radio telescopes collect radio waves and are sometimes used in large arrays.
• Space telescopes can see much more than Earth-bound telescopes, since the atmosphere doesn’t affect their

information.

1.22 Satellites, Shuttles, and Space Stations

• Describe tools astronomers use to study space.
• Explain how rockets ﬂy.
• Explain how satellites stay in orbit.
• Summarize the roles of the space shuttles.

Why are satellites important?
In 1900, a category 4 hurricane devastated Galveston, Texas. It claimed the lives of between 6,000 and 12,000
people. By contrast, the death toll from Hurricane Katrina was about 1,800 people. Why the difference? Although
Hurricane Katrina was a modern tragedy, it would have been much worse without the advance warning of many
weather satellites.

Rockets

Humans did not reach space until the second half of the 20th century. They needed somehow to break past Earth’s
gravity. A rocket moves rapidly in one direction. The device is propelled by particles ﬂying out of it at high speed

84

www.ck12.org

in the other direction.

How Rockets Work

Chapter 1. What is Science?

Rockets were used for centuries in wars and for ﬁreworks before anyone could explain how they worked. In 1687
Sir Isaac Newton developed his Laws of Motion. The third law says: To every action there is an equal and opposite
reaction.
In other words, when a rocket’s propulsion pushes in one direction, the rocket moves in the opposite
direction ( Figure 1.62).

FIGURE 1.62
A rocket pushes in one direction so that it
moves in the opposite direction.

For a long time, many people believed that a rocket wouldn’t work in space. There would be nothing for the rocket
to push against. But they do work! Fuel is ignited in a chamber. The gases in the chamber explode. The explosion
creates pressure that forces the gases out of one side of the rocket. The rocket moves in the opposite direction (
Figure 1.63). The force pushing the rocket is called thrust.

A Rocket Revolution

For centuries, rockets were powered by gunpowder or other solid fuels. These rockets could travel only short
distances. Around the turn of the 20th century, liquid fuel rockets were developed. Liquid fuel gave the rockets
enough power to escape Earth’s gravity. By using multiple stages, empty fuel containers could drop away. This
reduced the mass of the rocket so that it could ﬂy higher.

Satellites

One of the ﬁrst uses of rockets in space was to launch satellites. A satellite is an object that orbits a larger object.
An orbit is a circular or elliptical path around an object. Natural objects in orbit are called natural satellites. The
Moon is a natural satellite. Human-made objects in orbit are called artiﬁcial satellites.

FIGURE 1.63
This Space Shuttle launch shows how the
thrust of the rocket pushes the shuttle
upward into the sky.

How a Satellite Stays in Orbit

Newton’s law of universal gravitation describes how an object can orbit a planet. Every object in the Universe is
attracted to every other object by gravity. Gravity also keeps you from ﬂoating away into the sky. Why doesn’t
gravity cause satellites to crash into Earth?
Newton used an example to explain how gravity makes orbiting possible. Imagine a cannonball launched from a
high mountain ( Figure 1.64). If the cannonball is launched at a slow speed, it will fall back to Earth. This is
shown as paths (A) and (B). If the cannonball is launched at a fast speed, Earth curves away at the same rate that the
cannonball falls. The cannonball then goes into a circular orbit, as in path (C). If the cannonball is launched even
faster, it could go into an elliptical orbit (D). It might even leave Earth’s gravity and go into space (E).
Unfortunately, Newton’s idea would not work in real life. A cannonball launched at a fast speed from Mt. Everest
would burn up in the atmosphere. However, a rocket can launch straight up, then steer into orbit. It won’t burn up in
the atmosphere. So a rocket can carry a satellite above the atmosphere and then release the satellite into orbit.

Satellite Orbits

Satellites have different views depending on their orbit. Satellites may be put in a low orbit. These satellites orbit
from north to south over the poles. These satellites view a different part of Earth each time they circle. Imaging and
weather satellites need this type of view.
Satellites may be placed so that they orbit at the same rate the Earth spins. The satellite then remains over the same
location on the surface. Communications satellites are often placed in these orbits.

Types of Satellites

The ﬁrst artiﬁcial satellite was launched just over 50 years ago. Thousands are now in orbit around Earth. Satellites
also orbit the Moon, the Sun, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Satellites have many different purposes. There are
satellites for communications and navigation. There are satellites for taking pictures of a planet’s surface.
Dozens of satellites collect data about Earth. NASA’s Landsat satellites make detailed images of Earth’s continents
and coastal areas. Other satellites study the oceans, atmosphere, polar ice sheets, and other Earth systems. This data
helps us to monitor climate change. Other long-term changes in the planet are also best seen from space. Satellite

ﬁred from a high point with enough speed
could orbit Earth.

images help scientists understand how Earth’s systems affect one another. Different satellites monitor different
wavelengths of energy.

Space Stations

Humans have a presence in space at the International Space Station (ISS) ( Figure 1.65). Modern space stations
are constructed piece by piece to create a modular system. The primary purpose of the ISS is scientiﬁc research,
especially in medicine, biology, and physics.

FIGURE 1.65
A photograph of the International Space Station was taken from the space
shuttle Atlantis in June 2007.

Space Shuttles

Craft designed for human spaceﬂight, like the Apollo missions, were very successful. They were also very expensive
and could not carry much cargo. They could be used only once. To outﬁt the ISS, NASA needed a space vehicle
that was reusable. It needed to be able to carry large pieces of equipment. The cargo might include satellites, space
telescopes, or sections of a space station. The resulting spacecraft is called a space shuttle ( Figure 1.66).

FIGURE 1.66
Atlantis on the launch pad in 2006. Since 1981, the space shuttle has
been the United States’ primary vehicle for carrying people and large
equipment into space.

A space shuttle has three main parts. The part you are probably most familiar with is the orbiter. The orbiter has
wings like an airplane. When a space shuttle launches, the orbiter is attached to a huge fuel tank that contains liquid
fuel. On the sides of the fuel tank are two large "booster rockets." All of this is needed to get the orbiter out of
Earth’s atmosphere. Once in space, the orbiter can be used to release equipment (such as a satellite or supplies for
the International Space Station). It can be used to repair existing equipment, such as the Hubble Space Telescope.
Astronauts can even do experiments directly on board the orbiter.
When the mission is complete, the orbiter re-enters Earth’s atmosphere. The craft ﬂies back to Earth more like a
glider than an airplane. The Space Shuttle program did 135 missions between 1981 and 2011, when the remaining
shuttles were retired. Since the space shuttles have retired, the ISS is serviced by Russian Soyuz spacecraft.
You can visit the retired shuttles around the country:

• Enterprise at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, New York City.
• Discovery at the National Air and Space Museum, Chantilly Virginia.
• Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida.
• Endeavour at the California Science Center, Los Angeles.

Summary

• Rockets are propelled into space by particles ﬂying out one end at high speed. This allows them to escape

gravity.

• Thousands of artiﬁcial satellites orbit Earth. Satellites are used for imaging, communications, navigation, and

human habitation.

• Space stations are continuously inhabited by humans. The humans reach the space station by space shuttle.

Summary

Science is different from other ways of understanding the world. Science has a rigorous method of getting infor-
mation. A scientiﬁc idea must be testable; it must be falsiﬁable. Scientiﬁc ideas are not the result of opinion, gut
feelings, or faith. Ideas that are not supported by observations and data are revised or thrown out. Scientists use
the scientiﬁc method to answer questions about the natural world. The scientiﬁc method is not linear. A step may
need to be revised or thrown out. New data send the scientist back to the beginning. Still scientiﬁc inquiry takes
on this basic structure: Ask a question. Do background research. Propose a hypothesis. Test the hypothesis using
data from observations and experiments. Continue testing the hypothesis if it holds up or ﬁnd a new hypothesis if
it does not. Eventually create a theory. A theory is an explanation of a complicated set of phenomena. A theory
ﬁts virtually all of the available data. The theories of evolution, plate tectonics, and climate change are crucial to
understanding Earth. These theories may be revised, but they will almost certainly hold up. Earth scientists learn
about the world by using a lot of amazing tools and scientiﬁc principles. To understand things that are small or far
away, scientists use a microscope or a telescope. To learn about things on the ground, they use a map. Rocks and
other Earth materials are analyzed in the lab. Technology allows us to learn more about the oceans and space. One

of the most important principles—and the most important for understanding Earth history—is that "the present is
the key to the past."

Introduction

Chapter 2. Earth as a Planet

Is Earth a planet?
Yes! No one doubts that Earth is a planet. But Earth is a lot different from the other planets in our solar system. The
outer planets are huge and made of gas, like Jupiter. The inner planets are also different, like scorching-hot Venus.
Earth is different because it has liquid water. It also has life! Life may be found on another planet or moon in our
solar system. But it will not be intelligent life. We humans have looked around to know that! There was a planet
that was really different from the other planets. That planet is no longer a planet. Pluto is now categorized as a
dwarf planet. To decide what to do with Pluto, scientists had to decide what a planet is. We will look at some of the
characteristics that make Earth a bona ﬁde planet.

2.1. Earth’s Shape

2.1 Earth’s Shape

• Describe how we know that Earth is round.
• Explain how the four hemispheres are determined.

What is a ﬂat-earther?
Flat-earther is a term used to describe someone who believes something despite the evidence. Or who does not
believe something despite the evidence. There are actually people who believe that Earth is ﬂat. They say that
satellite photos are faked. They believe that the Apollo Moon landings were faked. But there are very few people
alive today who actually believe that Earth is ﬂat. There are, however, plenty of people who can be called ﬂat-
earthers. These people believe (or disbelieve) something despite the evidence.

Earth’s Shape

As you walk around, the ground looks ﬂat. So why do you think that Earth is round? The best reason is that we have
pictures of Earth taken from space. These photos show that Earth is round. Astronauts aboard the Apollo 17 shuttle
took this one, called “The Blue Marble” ( Figure 2.1). Earth looks like a giant blue and white ball.

FIGURE 2.1
This is how the Earth looks from space—like a blue and white marble.

Chapter 2. Earth as a Planet

Did people only come to think that Earth is round when spacecrafts took photos? No! Even the ancient Greeks knew
that Earth was round. They ﬁgured this out by observing the arc shape of the shadow on the Moon during a lunar
eclipse. Since Galileo, people can look through a telescope and see that the planets orbit around the Sun. These
bodies—the Sun and each of the planets—are round. If Earth is a planet, it is certainly round.
Another way to tell that Earth is round is to look at ships sailing off into the distance. What do you see when you
watch a tall ship sail over the horizon of the Earth? The bottom part of the ship disappears faster than the top part
( Figure 2.2). What would that ship look like if Earth were ﬂat? No part of it would disappear before the other. It
would all just get smaller as it moved farther away.

FIGURE 2.2
Earth’s curvature is noticeable when objects at a distance are below the
arc.

Hemispheres

Earth is a sphere (technically, an oblate spheroid, a bit squashed at the poles). As a sphere, it can be divided. Half of
a sphere is a hemisphere. Earth is divided into hemispheres: north, south, east, west ( Figure 2.3).
Remember that the Equator is the line that falls at 0°. North of the Equator is the Northern Hemisphere. South of
the Equator is the Southern Hemisphere. The North Pole is at 90°N. So there are 90 degree lines in the Northern
Hemisphere. The South Pole is 90°S. So there are 90 degree lines in the Southern Hemisphere.
Earth also has an Eastern Hemisphere and a Western Hemisphere. They are just made by humans so that
locations can more easily be speciﬁed. The Prime Meridian is 0° longitude and passes through Greenwich, England.
The International Date Line is the 180° meridian. The Eastern Hemisphere is east of the Prime Meridian to the
International Date Line. It includes eastern Europe and Asia. The Western Hemisphere west of the Prime Meridian
to the International Date Line. It includes western Europe and the Americas.

FIGURE 2.3
The Northern, Southern, Eastern, and
Western Hemispheres are highlighted.

Summary

www.ck12.org

• Ancient Greeks knew that Earth was round. They saw the shadow the planet cast on the Moon during a lunar

eclipse.

• Through a simple telescope, the other planets appear to be round. So Earth must be round.
• A boat does not get smaller with distance but sinks below the horizon. This is more evidence that Earth is

round.

2.2 Earth’s Magnetic Field

• Describe Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld.

How can you ﬁnd your way?
You can use Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld to tell you where you want to go. A compass needle aligns with Earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld. People can navigate by ﬁnding magnetic north. If you know where north is, you can ﬁgure out how to get
anywhere. A compass is great for ﬁnding your way when you’re out in the ﬁeld!

Earth’s Magnetism

Earth has a magnetic ﬁeld ( Figure 2.4). The magnetic ﬁeld behaves like a giant bar magnet inside Earth. If you
have a large bar magnet, you can hang it from a string. Then watch as it aligns itself in a north-south direction. It
does this to line up with Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld.
The magnetic ﬁeld has north and south poles. The magnetic poles do not exactly match the geographic poles. So
the North Magnetic Pole is not the same as the geographic North Pole. The same is true of the South Pole. The
magnetic ﬁeld is created by the movement of molten metal in the outer core.
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld extends several thousand kilometers into space. It shields us from harmful radiation from the
Sun ( Figure 2.5).

FIGURE 2.4
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is like a bar magnet that resides in the center of the
planet.

FIGURE 2.5
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld protects the planet
from harmful radiation.

Magnetic Reversals

Something very strange has happened many times during Earth’s history. The planet’s magnetic ﬁeld ﬂipped! The
North Magnetic Pole became the South Magnetic Pole. The South Magnetic Pole became the North Magnetic Pole.
Scientists are not sure why this happens. The fact that it does happen is useful to scientists. In the chapter Plate
Tectonics, you’ll learn how.

Summary

• Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is like a bar magnet through the planet.
• The magnetic ﬁeld is generated by convection in the liquid outer core.
• Occasionally the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂips. The North Magnetic Pole becomes the South Magnetic Pole and the

South Magnetic Pole becomes the North Magnetic Pole.

2.3. Gravity in the Solar System

www.ck12.org

2.3 Gravity in the Solar System

• Deﬁne gravity.
• Explain how mass and distance inﬂuence the gravitational attraction between two objects.

Did you ever hear the old adage: What goes up must come down?
Every moment of every day is a ﬁeld trip to gravity. Gravity is everywhere! You have a gravitational attraction to
your dog. You have one to your pencil. You even have one to your school principal! These gravitational attractions
are very small compared with the most important one you have. This is your gravitational attraction to Earth. It’s
what keeps you from ﬂoating off into space. Gravity holds our planet together. Gravity keeps Earth orbiting the Sun.
We wouldn’t be here without gravity.

The Role of Gravity

All objects in the universe have an attraction to each other. This attraction is known as gravity ( Figure 2.6). The
strength of the force of gravity depends on two things. One is the mass of the objects. The other is the distance
between the objects. As an object’s mass increases, the attraction increases. As the distance between the objects
increases, the attraction decreases.
Isaac Newton ﬁrst described gravity as the force that causes objects to fall to the ground. Gravity is also the force
that keeps the Moon circling Earth. Gravity keeps Earth circling the Sun. Without gravity, these objects would ﬂy
off into space ( Figure 2.7).
Gravity pulls any object on or near Earth toward the planet’s center.

FIGURE 2.6
The strength of the force of gravity be-
tween objects A and B depends on the
mass of the objects and the distance (u)
between them.

FIGURE 2.7

Moon system orbits the Sun.

Summary

• All objects have a gravitational attraction to each other. This is called gravity.
• The attraction is proportional to the mass of the objects. The attraction is inversely proportional to the distance

between the objects.

• Gravity keeps the Moon orbiting Earth. Gravity keeps the planets orbiting the Sun.

2.4 Rotation of Earth

• Describe Earth’s rotation on its axis.
• Explain the day-night cycle.

How do you know Earth rotates?
Something amazing happens every day (unless you live very far north or very far south)! The amazing thing is that
the Sun rises in the east. It also sets in the west. We know that the Sun doesn’t actually move around Earth. What
causes the Sun to rise and set is that Earth rotates on its axis. This rotation creates day and night.

Earth’s Axis of Rotation

Imagine a line passing through the center of Earth. The line exits the planet at the top and at the bottom. The point
at the top is the North Pole. The point at the bottom is the South Pole. This imaginary line is called an axis. The
points are the north and south geographic poles. The geographic poles are different from the magnetic poles, and
they are in different places on the planet.

FIGURE 2.8
Earth rotates on an axis, an imaginary line
that goes from the North (celestial) Pole to
the South (celestial) Pole.

Note that Earth’s axis of rotation is tilted. The axis is not perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic. This plane is the
one that solar system bodies are mostly lined up in.

105

2.4. Rotation of Earth

www.ck12.org

Earth spins around its axis, just as a top spins around its spindle. This spinning movement is called rotation. The
axis is Earth’s axis of rotation. Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours.

Day-Night Cycle

To an observer looking down at the North Pole, Earth appears to rotate counterclockwise. From nearly all points on
Earth, the Sun appears to move across the sky from east to west each day. Of course, the Sun is not moving from
east to west at all; Earth is rotating. The Moon and stars also seem to rise in the east and set in the west.
Earth’s rotation means that there is a cycle of daylight and darkness approximately every 24 hours. This is the length
of a day. Different places experience sunset and sunrise at different times, and the amount of daylight and darkness
also differs by location.

Summary

• Sun, Moon, and stars appear to travel from east to west each day.
• Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours.
• Earth’s rotation causes the day-night cycle.

2.5. Coriolis Effect

www.ck12.org

2.5 Coriolis Effect

• Explain the Coriolis effect.

Is this an example of the Coriolis effect?
Does Coriolis determine which direction water in a toilet will swirl? Unfortunately, no. Friction and the power of
the ﬂush have too big an inﬂuence. But in the atmosphere and oceans, Coriolis affects ﬂow direction.

Coriolis Effect

The Coriolis effect is not a force, even though that’s what it is sometimes called. Coriolis does not force anything
to happen! Coriolis is an effect. What does that mean?
The Coriolis effect describes how Earth’s rotation steers winds and surface ocean currents. Unlike land, air and
water move freely (in the absence of obstacles). The Coriolis effect causes the path of a freely moving object to
appear to curve. This is because Earth is rotating beneath the object. So even though the object’s path is straight, it
appears to curve. The curve appears to be to the right in the Northern Hemisphere. It appears to be to the left in the
Southern Hemisphere.
Here is an example in the Northern Hemisphere. A plane takes off from City A . The pilot wants to land in City B,
which is 500 miles due north. But the plane will not arrive there without corrections. City B was due north of City
A when the plane took off. But during the time it takes for the airplane to ﬂy 500 miles, City B moves east. This
happens because of Earth’s rotation. So if the airplane ﬂies due north, it will arrive at a different city, City C. City C
is west of City B (in the Northern Hemisphere). To reach City B, the pilot should curve right while ﬂying north. The

108

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Earth as a Planet

opposite happens in the Southern Hemisphere. In the ﬂights between cities pictured below ( Figure 2.9), the ﬂight
paths look curved. Since a ﬂight path must curve to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, can you tell which city
the plane took off from in each case?

FIGURE 2.9
The Coriolis effect is the reason that airlines’ ﬂight paths look curved, even
though they are the shortest possible path. Although these ﬂight paths
show curves, what’s wrong with this picture? (The curves do not all follow
the path due to Coriolis.)

Effect for Air or Water

As wind or an ocean current moves, the Earth spins underneath it. Wind or water that travels toward the poles from
the Equator curves to the east. Wind or water that travels toward the Equator from the poles curves to the west. The
Coriolis effect bends the direction of surface currents to the right in the Northern Hemisphere. The currents curve
left in the Southern Hemisphere ( Figure 2.10).

FIGURE 2.10
The Coriolis effect causes winds and cur-
rents to form circular patterns. The di-
rection that
they spin depends on the
hemisphere that they are in.

Summary

• Earth rotates beneath freely moving objects like water and air. Compared with a spot on the planet, the objects

appear to be moving.

• Freely moving objects appear to move right in the Northern Hemisphere. They appear to move left in the

Southern Hemisphere.

• Coriolis is an effect rather than a force. Coriolis does not force a motion. An object appears to have a change

of motion due to the Coriolis effect.

2.6 Seasons

• Explain why seasons occur.
• Deﬁne summer solstice, winter solstice, and equinox.

Do you like the seasons?
Do you live in a place with well-deﬁned seasons? Do you appreciate the change of the seasons? In other words, are
you happy that Earth’s axis is tilted?

Earth’s Seasons

Some people think that Earth is closer to the Sun in the summer and farther away from the Sun in the the winter.
But that’s not true! Why can’t that be true? Because when it’s summer in one hemisphere, it’s winter in the other.
So what does cause the seasons? The seasons are caused by the 23.5° tilt of Earth’s axis. One hemisphere points
more directly toward the Sun than the other hemisphere. As Earth orbits the Sun, the tilt of Earth’s axis stays lined
up with the North Star.
Solstice refers to the position of the Sun when it is closest to one of the poles. At equinox, the Sun is directly over
the Equator.

Northern Hemisphere Summer

During summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted toward the Sun. The Sun’s rays strike the
Northern Hemisphere more directly ( Figure 2.11). The region gets a lot of sunlight. Summer solstice is June
21 or 22. At that time, the Sun’s rays hit directly at the Tropic of Cancer (23.5°N). This is the farthest north that
the Sun will be directly overhead. Summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere is winter solstice in the Southern
Hemisphere.

FIGURE 2.11
Summer solstice in the Northern Hemi-
sphere.

Northern Hemisphere Winter

Winter solstice for the Northern Hemisphere happens on December 21 or 22. The North Pole of Earth’s axis points
away from the Sun ( Figure 2.12). Light from the Sun is spread out over a larger area. With fewer daylight hours
in winter, there is also less time for the Sun to warm the area. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is
summer in the Southern Hemisphere.

FIGURE 2.12
During summer in the Southern Hemi-
sphere, the Sun’s rays directly strike the
Tropic of Capricorn (23.5°S). Sunlight is
spread across a large area near the South
Pole. No sunlight reaches the North Pole.

An animation of the seasons from the University of Illinois is seen here: http://projects.astro.illinois.edu/data/Seas
ons/seasons.html . Notice the area of solar radiation, or insolation, in the lower right of the screen.

Equinox

Equinox comes halfway between the two solstices. At equinoxes, the Sun’s rays shine most directly at the Equator
( Figure 2.13). The daylight and nighttime hours are exactly equal on an equinox. The autumnal, or fall, equinox
happens on September 22 or 23. The vernal, or spring, equinox happens March 21 or 22 in the Northern Hemisphere.

Summary

• Earth has seasons because of the (23.5°) tilt of its axis of rotation.
• In the Northern Hemisphere, at summer solstice the Sun is closest to the North Pole (around June 22). At

2.7 Revolutions of Earth

• Describe Earth’s revolution around the Sun.

What kind of revolution are we talking about?
Copernicus caused a revolution. He said that Earth revolved around the Sun. With his telescope, Galileo found a lot
of evidence for this. He could see moons orbiting Jupiter. If moons can orbit Jupiter, surely Earth can orbit the Sun.
Yes? In the two images above, you can see Jupiter at two different times, showing moons in different places.

Earth’s Revolution

Earth orbits a star. That star is our Sun. One revolution around the Sun takes 365.24 days. That is equal to one year.
Earth stays in orbit around the Sun because of the Sun’s gravity ( Figure 2.14).
Earth’s orbit is not a circle. It is a bit elliptical. So as we travel around the Sun, sometimes we are a little farther
away from the Sun. Sometimes we are closer to the Sun.
Students sometimes think the slightly oval shape of our orbit causes Earth’s seasons. That’s not true! The seasons
are due to the tilt of Earth’s axis, as discussed in the previous concept.

FIGURE 2.14
Earth and the other planets in the solar
system make elliptical orbits around the
Sun. The ellipses in this image are highly
exaggerated.

The distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers. Earth revolves
around the Sun at an average speed of about 27 kilometers (17 miles) per second. Mercury and Venus are closer
to the Sun, so they take shorter times to make one orbit. Mercury takes only about 88 Earth days to make one trip
around the Sun. All of the other planets take longer amounts of time. The exact amount depends on the planet’s

distance from the Sun. Saturn takes more than 29 Earth years to make one revolution around the Sun. How old
would you be if you were on Jupiter?

2.8 Solar Eclipses

• Describe solar eclipses.

Can you see a solar eclipse?
Of course! This photo of a partial solar eclipse was taken on May 20, 2012 in Gilbert, Arizona. The maximum
was 82% at that location. Further north people experienced totality. The next two eclipses in North America will
be a partial on October 23, 2014 and a total on August 21, 2017. If you try to view an eclipse, be sure you use eye
protection!

Solar Eclipses

When a new moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun, it causes a solar eclipse ( Figure 2.15). The Moon
casts a shadow on the Earth and blocks our view of the Sun. This only happens if all three are lined up and in the
same plane. This plane is called the ecliptic. The ecliptic is the plane of Earth’s orbit around the Sun.
The Moon’s shadow has two distinct parts. The umbra is the inner, cone-shaped part of the shadow. It is the part in
which all of the light has been blocked. The penumbra is the outer part of Moon’s shadow. It is where the light is
only partially blocked.
When the Moon’s shadow completely blocks the Sun, it is a total solar eclipse ( Figure 2.16). If only part of the Sun
is out of view, it is a partial solar eclipse. Solar eclipses are rare events. They usually only last a few minutes. That
is because the Moon’s shadow only covers a very small area on Earth, and Earth is turning very rapidly.

FIGURE 2.15
During a solar eclipse, the Moon casts a shadow on the Earth. The
shadow is made up of two parts:
the darker umbra and the lighter
penumbra.

Solar eclipses are amazing to experience. The light disappears so that it’s like night, only strange. Birds may sing as
they do at dusk. Stars become visible in the sky. It gets colder outside. Unlike at night, though, the Sun is out. So
during a solar eclipse, it’s easy to see the Sun’s corona and solar prominences. This NASA page will inform you on
when solar eclipses are expected: http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/solar.html

Summary

• During a solar eclipse, the new moon passes between Earth and Sun.
• The umbra is the part of the shadow in which light is completely blocked.
• The penumbra is the part of the shadow that is partially lit.

2.9 Lunar Eclipses

• Describe lunar eclipses.

Can you see a lunar eclipse?
Again, of course! Anyone with a view of the Moon can see a lunar eclipse. The next four total lunar eclipses
predicted for North America will be on April 15, 2014, October 8, 2014, April 5, 2015, and September 28, 2015.

Lunar Eclipses

Sometimes a full moon moves through Earth’s shadow. This is a lunar eclipse ( Figure 2.17). During a total lunar
eclipse, the Moon travels completely in Earth’s umbra. During a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon
enters Earth’s umbra. When the Moon passes through Earth’s penumbra, it is a penumbral eclipse. Since Earth’s
shadow is large, a lunar eclipse lasts for hours.
Partial lunar eclipses occur at least twice a year, but total lunar eclipses are less common. The Moon glows with a
dull red coloring during a total lunar eclipse ( Figure 2.18).

Summary

• During a lunar eclipse, the full moon moves through Earth’s shadow.
• Earth’s shadow is large so lunar eclipses last longer than solar eclipses. They cover more area too.
• The umbra is the part of the shadow in which light is completely blocked.
• The penumbra is the part of the shadow that is partially lit.

2.10 Lunar Phases

• List the names of the phases of the moon.
• Describe what causes the phases of the Moon.

Can the Moon cast shadows?
Of course! A full moon is very bright. It is bright enough to cast shadows. If you are out away from city lights and
the Moon is full you might cast your own Moon shadow.

123

2.10. Lunar Phases

The Phases of the Moon

www.ck12.org

The Moon does not produce any light of its own. It only reﬂects light from the Sun. The Moon has phases because
it orbits around Earth. One orbit takes about 28 days. As the moon moves around Earth, different parts of it appear
to be lit up by the Sun. The Moon sometimes appears fully lit and sometimes completely dark. Sometimes it is
partially lit. The different appearances of the Moon are referred to as phases of the Moon ( Figure 2.19).
A full moon occurs when the whole side facing Earth is lit. This happens when Earth is between the Moon and the
Sun.

FIGURE 2.19
The moon’s phases are a result of the moon’s orbit around Earth.

About one week later, the Moon enters the quarter-moon phase. Only half of the Moon’s lit surface is visible from
Earth, so it appears as a half circle.
Another week later, the Moon moves between Earth and the Sun. The side of the Moon facing Earth is completely
dark. This is called a new moon. Sometimes you can just barely make out the outline of the new moon in the sky.
This is because some sunlight reﬂects off the Earth and hits the Moon.
One week after that, the Moon is in another quarter-moon phase. Finally, in one more week, the Moon is back to
full.
Before and after the quarter-moon phases are the gibbous and crescent phases. During the crescent moon phase, the
Moon is less than half lit. It is seen as only a sliver or crescent shape. During the gibbous moon phase, the Moon is
more than half lit. It is not full. The Moon undergoes a complete cycle of phases about every 29.5 days.

Summary

• The appearance of the Moon from Earth has distinct phases.
• A full moon is completely lit; a new moon is completely dark.
• A gibbous moon is more than half lit; a crescent moon is less than half lit.

2.11 Earth’s Interior

• Explain seismic waves.
• Describe the ways in which scientists can learn about what’s in Earth’s interior.

How deep can we go into Earth’s interior?
Not very deep, that’s for sure! The deepest a drill hole has gotten was the Kola Superdeep Borehole. That hole got
to 40,230 feet (12,262 m), about one-third of the way into the crust in that area. So learning about what’s deeper
requires less direct methods. A few of these methods will be described in this concept.

Learning About Earth’s Interior

If someone told you to ﬁgure out what is inside Earth, what would you do? How could you ﬁgure out what is inside
our planet? How do scientists ﬁgure it out?

Seismic Waves

Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth’s interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus.
These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure 2.20). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials.

126

www.ck12.org

Chapter 2. Earth as a Planet

They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic
waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to
understand what makes up the Earth’s interior.

FIGURE 2.20
The properties of seismic waves allow
scientists to understand the composition
of Earth’s interior.

Meteorites

Scientists study meteorites to learn about Earth’s interior. Meteorites formed in the early solar system. These objects
represent early solar system materials ( Figure 2.21). Some meteorites are made of iron and nickel. They are thought
to be very similar to Earth’s core. An iron meteorite is the closest thing to a sample of the core that scientists can
hold in their hands!

FIGURE 2.21
This meteorite contains the maﬁc minerals olivine and pyroxene.
It also
contains metal ﬂakes, similar to the material that separated into Earth’s
core (metal) and mantle (ultramaﬁc rock).

Density

Earth’s overall density is higher than the density of crustal rocks, so the core must be made of something dense, like
metal.

Magnetic Field

Since Earth has a magnetic ﬁeld, there must be metal within the planet. Iron and nickel are both magnetic.

2.12 Earth’s Outer Layers

• Identify Earth’s layers and describe their characteristics.

Does this look familiar?
Gases, water, rock, and living organisms are all found at Earth’s surface. These materials are also found above or
below the surface. They interact with each other and in doing so alter each other. For example, the hydrosphere may
cause some of the lithosphere to wash away.

Spheres

Earth is made of layers. Since Earth is round, the layers all have the ending "-sphere" ( Figure 2.22).
Some of the different parts of the Earth are the:

• Atmosphere: The thin layer of air, mostly nitrogen and oxygen, that surrounds the Earth.
• Hydrosphere: All the water on Earth.
• Biosphere: All the living organisms on Earth.
• Lithosphere: The solid rock part of Earth, including mountains, valleys, continents, and all of the rock beneath

the oceans.

All of Earth’s layers interact. Therefore, Earth’s surface is constantly undergoing changes.

• Describe the characteristics of Earth’s layers.
• Distinguish the lithosphere and from the asthenosphere.

What’s below our feet? What’s way below?
If we could cut Earth open, we’d see the following layers from inside to outside: inner core, outer core, mantle, and
crust. Alternatively, you can think of the brittle lithosphere riding on the plastic asthenosphere. Whew!

Layers by Composition

The layers scientists recognize are pictured below ( Figure 2.23).
Core, mantle, and crust are divisions based on composition:

1. The crust is less than 1% of Earth by mass. The two types are oceanic crust and continental crust.
2. The mantle is hot, dense, dark (ultramaﬁc) rock. It represents about 68% of Earth’s mass.
3. The core is mostly iron metal. The core makes up about 31% of the Earth. Earth’s metallic core has two

layers: a solid inner layer and a liquid outer layer.

The terms core, mantle, and crust will be described in more detail in the next three concepts.

Layers by Mechanical Properties

Lithosphere and asthenosphere are divisions based on mechanical properties:

1. The lithosphere is composed of both the crust and the uppermost mantle. The lithosphere is a brittle, rigid

solid. It is easily cracked or broken.

2. The asthenosphere is below the lithosphere. The asthenosphere is also in the upper mantle. This layer is

solid, but it can ﬂow and bend. A solid that can ﬂow is like silly putty.

This animation shows the layers by composition and by mechanical properties: http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/eoc/teach

• By composition, Earth is divided into core, mantle, and crust.
• By mechanical properties, the crust and upper mantle are divided into lithosphere and asthenosphere.

2.14 Earth’s Crust

• Deﬁne Earth’s crust.
• Describe the characteristics of Earth’s two types of crust.

What do these two photos have in common?
Both of these photos are of Earth’s crust. The crust on the left is on the continent. It’s what you see and walk on
every day. The crust on the right is in the ocean. You may have seen pictures, but to see it in person you need special
equipment.

Crust

Crust, mantle, and core differ from each other in chemical composition. It’s understandable that scientists know the
most about the crust, and less about deeper layers. Earth’s crust is a thin, brittle outer shell. The crust is made of
rock. This layer is thinner under the oceans and much thicker in mountain ranges.

Oceanic Crust

There are two kinds of crust. Oceanic crust is made of basalt lavas that ﬂow onto the seaﬂoor ( Figure 2.24). It is
relatively thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 - 8 miles). The rocks of the oceanic crust are denser (3.0 g/cm3)
than the rocks that make up the continents. Thick layers of mud cover much of the ocean ﬂoor.

FIGURE 2.24
Gabbro is a dark dense rock that can be found in oceanic crust.

135

2.14. Earth’s Crust

Continental Crust

www.ck12.org

Continental crust is much thicker than oceanic crust. It is 35 kilometers (22 miles) thick on average, but it varies
a lot. Continental crust is made up of many different rocks ( Figure 2.25). All three major rock types—igneous,
metamorphic, and sedimentary—are found in the crust. On average, continental crust is much less dense (2.7 g/cm3)
than oceanic crust. Since it is less dense, it rises higher above the mantle than oceanic crust.

FIGURE 2.25
The average composition of continental crust is granite.

Summary

• Oceanic crust is thinner and denser than continental crust.
• Oceanic crust is darker in color and denser (more maﬁc). Continental crust is lighter in color and density

(more felsic).

• Earth’s crust is very thin relative to Earth’s radius.

2.15 Earth’s Mantle

• Describe the rock of Earth’s mantle.
• Deﬁne convection and conduction.
• Describe the movement of heat in the mantle.

What does mantle rock look like?
You can’t go to the mantle but small pieces of the mantle can come to you. Kimberlite forms deep in the mantle and
is erupted violently into the crust. Kimberlite can contain diamonds. Most kimberlites reached the surface much
earlier in Earth history.

Mantle

Beneath the crust is the mantle. The mantle is made of hot, solid rock. They know this because of seismic waves,
meteorites, and the heat that comes from inside the planet. Mantle rock is mostly peridotite, which is rich in iron
and magnesium ( Figure 2.26). Peridotite is rare at Earth’s surface.

Heat Flow

Through the process of conduction, heat ﬂows from warmer objects to cooler objects ( Figure 2.27). The lower
mantle is heated directly by conduction from the core. In conduction, heat is transferred as atoms collide.
Hot lower mantle material rises upward ( Figure 2.28). As it rises, it cools. At the top of the mantle it moves
horizontally. Over time it becomes cool and dense enough that it sinks. Back at the bottom of the mantle, it travels
horizontally. Eventually the material gets to the location where warm mantle material is rising. The rising and
sinking of warm and cooler material is called convection.

Yes! The outer core, anyway. The outer core is liquid metal, like in this photo. Of course, the metal is under an
incredible amount of pressure.

Core

The dense, iron core forms the center of the Earth. Scientists know that the core is metal. The inner core is solid,
and the outer core is molten. Here are some of the reasons they know this:

• Metallic meteorites are thought to be from the same type of material that is found at the core ( Figure 2.29).

• Scientists calculate Earth’s density from the planet’s rotation. To match the total density, the inner layers must

be denser than the outer layers. They must be as dense as metal.

• Seismic waves show that the outer core is liquid. The inner core is solid.

• For there to be a magnetic ﬁeld, there must be liquid metal. The metal must be convecting. If the core did not

have convecting metal, there would be no magnetic ﬁeld.

Summary

www.ck12.org

This Concept deals with some Earth basics. Earth is a planet and has the characteristics of a planet. Like other
planets, it is nearly round. This is because it has enough mass for its gravity to pull material into a round shape.
Earth’s gravity has also pulled in small objects, like asteroids. So the planet’s orbit is cleared. Earth rotates on its
axis and revolves around its star. As a result of its rotation, Earth has a day-night cycle. The tilt of its axis creates the
seasons. Earth has layers from crust to mantle to core. The core is divided into a liquid outer core and a solid inner
core. The liquid outer core has convection, which generates the magnetic ﬁeld. The mantle is solid rock. The crust
has two major types: continental and oceanic. The crust and uppermost mantle make up the lithosphere. Beneath
the lithosphere is the asthenosphere. The lithosphere is brittle and will break. The asthenosphere can ﬂow.

Chapter 3. Earth’s Materials and Crust

How can you learn about Earth’s crust?
Well, you could travel around and visit Earth’s crust in lots of places. You would see different minerals and rocks
everywhere you went. You would learn that certain rocks indicate that certain processes happened. For example, the
rock basalt means that there was a volcanic eruption nearby. Since it may not be practical to take such a big trip,
where else could you see materials from Earth’s crust? A museum is a great place! The next time you’re in a major
city, ﬁnd a way to spend a few hours in a natural history museum. In this Concept, we’ll learn about a variety of
Earth materials.

3.1 Atoms to Molecules

• Describe matter.
• Understand the parts of matter.
• Compare a molecule to a compound.

Can you see matter?
Matter is all around you. Everything you see is matter. All of this matter is made of small particles. The small
particles are made of smaller particles.

What is Matter?

To understand minerals, we must ﬁrst understand matter. Matter is the substance that physical objects are made of.

Atoms and Elements

The basic unit of matter is an atom ( Figure 3.1). At the center of an atom is its nucleus. Protons are positively
charged particles in the nucleus. Also in the nucleus are neutrons with no electrical charge. Orbiting the nucleus

146

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Earth’s Materials and Crust

are tiny electrons. Electrons are negatively charged. An atom with the same number of protons and electrons is
electrically neutral. If the atom has more or less electrons to protons it is called an ion. An ion will have positive
charge if it has more protons than electrons. It will have negative charge if it has more electrons than protons.

FIGURE 3.1
The nucleus of an atom is made up of pro-
tons (blue) and neutrons (yellow). Elec-
trons (red) orbit around the nucleus.

An atom is the smallest unit of a chemical element. That is, an atom has all the properties of that element. All atoms
of the same element have the same number of protons.

Molecules and Compounds

A molecule is the smallest unit of a chemical compound. A compound is a substance made of two or more elements.
The elements in a chemical compound are always present in a certain ratio.
Water is probably one of the simplest compounds that you know. A water molecule is made of two hydrogen atoms
and one oxygen atom ( Figure 3.2). All water molecules have the same ratio: two hydrogen ions to one oxygen ion.

FIGURE 3.2
A water molecule has two hydrogen ions (shown in gray) bonded to one
oxygen ion (shown in red).

Summary

www.ck12.org

• An atom has negatively-charged electrons in orbit around its nucleus.
• The nucleus of an atom is composed of positively-charged protons, and neutrons, which have no charge.
• An atom that gains or loses electrons is an ion.

3.2 Minerals

• Describe the characteristics that deﬁne minerals.
• Give examples of minerals.

Are you a mineral?
There used to be a TV commercial that said "you are what you eat." If that’s true, then you are partly the mineral
halite. That’s just table salt, after all.

What is a Mineral?

A mineral is a solid material that forms by a natural process. A mineral can be made of an element or a compound.
It has a speciﬁc chemical composition. Its chemical composition is different from other minerals. Each type of
mineral has physical properties that differ from others. These properties include crystal structure, hardness, density,
and color. For example, silver is a soft, shiny metal. Salt is a white, cube-shaped crystal. Diamond is an extremely
hard, translucent crystal.

Forms by Natural Processes

Minerals form by natural processes. Minerals are created by processes that happen in or on the Earth. For example,
when hot lava cools, mineral crystals form. Minerals also precipitate from water. Some minerals grow when rocks
are exposed to high pressures and temperatures.
Could a mineral be made by a process that was not natural? People make gemstones in a laboratory. Synthetic
diamond is a common one. But that stone is not a mineral. That’s because a mineral must be created by natural
processes. This is part of the deﬁnition of a mineral.

149

3.2. Minerals

Inorganic Substance

www.ck12.org

A mineral is an inorganic substance. It was not made by living organisms. Organic substances contain carbon. Some
types of organic substances are proteins, carbohydrates, and oils. Everything else is inorganic. In a few cases, living
organisms make inorganic materials. The calcium carbonate shells made by marine animals are inorganic.

Deﬁnite Composition

All minerals have a deﬁnite chemical makeup. A few minerals are made of only one kind of element. Silver is a
mineral made only of silver atoms. Diamond and graphite are both made only of the element carbon.
Minerals that are not just a single element are made of chemical compounds. For example, the mineral quartz is
made of the compound silicon dioxide, or SiO2. This compound has one atom of the element silicon for every two
atoms of the element oxygen.
Each mineral has its own unique chemical formula. For example, the mineral hematite has two iron atoms for every
three oxygen atoms. The mineral magnetite has three iron atoms for every four oxygen atoms. Many minerals have
very complex chemical formulas that include several elements. However, even in more complicated compounds, the
elements occur in deﬁnite ratios.

Solid Crystals

Minerals must be solid. For example, ice and water have the same chemical composition. Ice is a solid, so it is a
mineral. Water is a liquid, so it is not a mineral.
Some solids are not crystals. Glass, or the rock obsidian, are solid. However, they are not crystals. In a crystal, the
atoms are arranged in a pattern. This pattern is regular and it repeats. The image below shows how the atoms are
arranged in halite (table salt) ( Figure 3.3). Halite contains atoms of sodium and chlorine in a pattern. Notice that
the pattern goes in all three dimensions.

FIGURE 3.3
Sodium ions (purple balls) bond with chloride ions (green balls) to form
halite crystals.

The pattern of atoms in all halite is the same. Think about all of the grains of salt that are in a salt shaker. The atoms
are arranged in the same way in every piece of salt.
Sometimes two different minerals have the same chemical composition. But they are different minerals because they
have different crystal structures. Diamonds are very valuable as gemstones because they are very pretty and very
hard. Graphite is the “lead” in pencils. It’s not hard at all! Amazingly, both are made just of carbon. Compare the
diamond with the pencil lead ( Figure 3.4). Why are they so different? The carbon atoms in graphite bond to form
layers. The bonds between each layer are weak. The carbon sheets can just slip past each other. The carbon atoms
in diamonds bond together in all three directions. This strong network makes diamonds very hard.

Chapter 3. Earth’s Materials and Crust

FIGURE 3.4
Diamonds (A) and graphite (B) are both
made of only carbon, but they’re not much
alike.

Physical Properties

The patterns of atoms affect a mineral’s physical properties. A mineral’s crystal shape is determined by the way the
atoms are arranged. For example, you can see how atoms are arranged in halite ( Figure 3.3). Below, you can see
how salt crystals look under a microscope ( Figure 3.5). Salt crystals are all cubes whether they’re small or large.

FIGURE 3.5
Under a microscope, salt crystals are cubes. In this crystal, the corners
have worn away.

Physical properties help scientists identify different minerals; this is explored in the concept "Mineral Identiﬁcation."

Summary

• A mineral is an inorganic, crystalline solid.
• A mineral forms through natural processes. It has a deﬁnite chemical composition.
• Minerals can be identiﬁed by their characteristic physical properties. They include crystalline structure,

hardness, density, breakage, and color.

3.3 Mineral Groups

• List the mineral groups.
• Describe the characteristics of the different mineral groups.

What would you do with this mineral?
Imagine you are in charge of organizing more than 100 minerals for a museum exhibit. You know that people learn
more if they see the minerals together in groups. So how would you group the minerals together in the exhibit?
What are some of the possibilities? Size? Shape? Color?

Mineral Groups

Mineralogists are scientists who study minerals. They divide minerals into groups based on chemical composition.
Even though there are over 4,000 minerals, most minerals ﬁt into one of eight mineral groups.

Silicate Minerals

Silicates are the largest mineral group. About 1,000 silicate minerals are known. Silicate minerals are also extremely
common. They make up over 90% of Earth’s crust!

153

3.3. Mineral Groups

www.ck12.org

Silicates contain silicon atoms and oxygen atoms. One silicon atom is bonded to four oxygen atoms. These atoms
form a tetrahedron ( Figure 3.6). The silica tetrahedron is the building block of silicate minerals. Most silicates
contain other elements. These elements include calcium, iron, and magnesium.

FIGURE 3.6
One silicon atom bonds to four oxygen
atoms to form a pyramid

Silicate minerals are divided into six smaller groups. In each group, the silicate pyramids join together differently.
The pyramids can stand alone. They can form into connected circles called rings. Some pyramids link into single
and double chains. Others form large, ﬂat sheets. Some join in three dimensions.
Feldspar and quartz are the two most common silicates. In beryl, the silicate pyramids join together as rings. Biotite
is mica. The silicate pyramids come together to create thin, ﬂexible sheets. Compare the beryl and the biotite
pictured below ( Figure 3.7).

FIGURE 3.7
Beryl (a) and biotite (b) are both silicate
minerals.

Native Elements

Native elements contain only atoms of one type of element. They are not combined with other elements. There are
very few examples of these types of minerals. Some native elements are rare and valuable. Gold, silver, sulfur, and
diamond are examples.

154

www.ck12.org

Carbonates

Chapter 3. Earth’s Materials and Crust

What do you guess carbonate minerals contain? If you guessed carbon, you would be right! All carbonates contain
one carbon atom bonded to three oxygen atoms. Carbonates may include other elements. A few of these are calcium,
iron, and copper.
Carbonate minerals are often found where seas once covered the land. Some carbonate minerals are very common.
Calcite contains calcium, carbon, and oxygen. Have you ever been in a limestone cave or seen a marble tile? Calcite
is in both limestone and marble. Azurite and malachite are also carbonate minerals. They contain copper instead of
calcium. They are not as common as calcite. Malachite and azurite are used in jewelry; as you can see, they are very
colorful ( Figure 3.8).

FIGURE 3.8

(a) The deep blue mineral
(b) This
and the green is malachite.
red rhodochrosite is a carbonate mineral.
Rhodochrosite is usually pink;
the red
crystals are rare.

Halides

Halide minerals are salts. They form when salt water evaporates. This mineral class includes more than just table
salt. Halide minerals may contain the elements ﬂuorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Some halide minerals combine
with metal elements. Common table salt is a halide mineral that contains the elements chlorine and sodium. Fluorite
is a type of halide that contains ﬂuorine and calcium. Fluorite can be found in many colors. If you shine an ultraviolet
light on ﬂuorite, it will glow!

Oxides

Earth’s crust contains a lot of oxygen. The oxygen can combine with other elements to create oxide minerals. Oxides
contain one or two metal elements combined with oxygen. Oxides are different from silicates, because they do not
contain silicon. Many important metals are found as oxides. For example, hematite and magnetite are both oxides
that contain iron. Hematite (Fe2O3) has a ratio of two iron atoms to three oxygen atoms. Magnetite (Fe3O4) has
a ratio of three iron atoms to four oxygen atoms. Notice that the word “magnetite” contains the word “magnet."
Magnetite ( Figure 3.9) is a magnetic mineral.

Phosphates

Phosphate minerals have a structure similar to silicates. In silicates, an atom of silicon is bonded to oxygen. In
phosphates, an atom of phosphorus, arsenic, or vanadium is bonded to oxygen. There are many types of phosphate

3.3. Mineral Groups

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 3.9
Magnetite is one of the most distinctive oxides since it is magnetic.

minerals, but phosphate minerals are rare. The composition of phosphates is complex. For example, turquoise
contains copper, aluminum, and phosphorus ( Figure 3.10).

FIGURE 3.10
Turquoise is a phosphate mineral with a beautiful blue color. The stone is
not as rare as some minerals and is commonly used for jewelry.

Sulfates

Sulfate minerals contain sulfur atoms bonded to oxygen atoms. Like halides, they can form in places where salt
water evaporates. Many minerals belong in the sulfate group, but there are only a few common sulfate minerals.
Gypsum is a common sulfate mineral that contains calcium, sulfate, and water. Gypsum is found in various forms.
For example, it can be pink and look like it has ﬂower petals. However, it can also grow into very large white
crystals. Gypsum crystals that are 11-meters-long have been found. That is about as long as a school bus! Gypsum
forms at the Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park ( Figure 3.11).

FIGURE 3.11
Gypsum is the white mineral that is com-
mon around hot springs. This is Mam-
moth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National
Park.

156

www.ck12.org

Sulﬁdes

Chapter 3. Earth’s Materials and Crust

Sulﬁdes contain metal elements combined with sulfur. Sulﬁdes are different from sulfates. They do not contain
oxygen. Pyrite is a common sulﬁde mineral ( Figure 3.12). It contains iron combined with sulfur. Pyrite is also
known as “fool’s gold.” Gold miners have mistaken pyrite for gold because pyrite has a greenish gold color.

FIGURE 3.12
Pyrite has a similar color to gold. The
appearance of the striations make pyrite
different from gold.

Summary

• Silicates, made of building blocks of silica tetrahedrons, are the most abundant minerals on Earth.
• Silica tetrahedrons combine together in six different ways to create rings, single and double chains, large ﬂat

sheets, or 3-dimensional structures.

• Other mineral groups have other chemical components like carbonates, oxides, or phosphates.
• Minerals that are native elements are made of only one element.

3.4 Mineral Identiﬁcation

• Describe the characteristics that are used to identify minerals.

How do you identify a mineral?
You’re in a competition getting ready to go onstage. You discover that you forgot your shirt! You call your mom and
ask her (nicely) to bring it to you right away. But ﬁrst you need to let her know which shirt it is. What would you
tell her? You might describe the color, the way the fabric feels, and the length of the sleeves. These are all physical
properties of your shirt. If you do a good job describing the shirt your mom will bring the right one. Minerals also
have physical properties that are used to identify them.

How are Minerals Identiﬁed?

Imagine you were given a mineral sample similar to the pictured below ( Figure 3.13). You can use a mineral’s
properties to identify what type it is. How would you try to identify your mineral? You can observe some properties
by looking at the mineral. For example, you can see that its color is green. The mineral has a needle-like, ﬁbrous
structure. But you can’t see all mineral properties. You need to do simple tests to determine some properties.
One common one is how hard the mineral is. The mineral’s physical properties are determined by its chemical
composition and crystal structure.

FIGURE 3.13

3.4. Mineral Identiﬁcation

Color, Streak, and Luster

www.ck12.org

Diamonds have many valuable properties. Diamonds are translucent and extremely hard. The most valuable
diamonds are large, well-shaped and sparkly. Some are not as pretty and are used for industrial purposes. Turquoise
is another mineral that is used in jewelry because of its striking greenish-blue color. Many minerals have interesting
appearances. Speciﬁc terms are used to describe the appearance of minerals.

Color

Color is probably the easiest property to observe. Unfortunately, you can rarely identify a mineral only by its color.
Sometimes, different minerals are the same color. For example, you might ﬁnd a mineral that is a golden color and
think it is gold. But it might actually be pyrite, or “fool’s gold,” which is made of iron and sulﬁde. It contains no
gold atoms.
A certain mineral may form in different colors. For example, pictured below are four samples of quartz ( Figure
3.14 shows), including one that is colorless and one that is purple. The purple color comes from a tiny amount of
iron. Iron is not normally found in quartz. When it is, it is a chemical impurity. Many minerals are colored by
chemical impurities. Other factors can also affect a mineral’s color. Weathering changes the surface of a mineral.
Because color alone is unreliable, geologists rarely identify a mineral just on its color. To identify most minerals,
they use several properties.

FIGURE 3.14
Quartz comes in many different colors
including: (A) transparent quartz, (B) blue
agate, (C) rose quartz, and (D) purple
amethyst.

Streak

Streak is the color of the powder of a mineral. To do a streak test, you scrape the mineral across an unglazed
porcelain plate. The plate is harder than many minerals, causing the minerals to leave a streak of powder on the
plate. The color of the streak often differs from the color of the larger mineral sample ( Figure 3.15). Yellow-
gold pyrite has a blackish streak. This blackish streak tells you that the mineral is not gold, because gold has a
gold-colored streak.
Streak is more reliable than color to identify minerals. Different minerals that are the same color may have a
different color streak. For example, samples of hematite and galena are both dark gray. They can be told apart
because hematite has a red streak and galena has a gray streak.

Luster

Luster describes the way light reﬂects off of the surface of the mineral. You might describe diamonds as sparkly or
pyrite as shiny. But mineralogists have special terms to describe luster. They ﬁrst divide minerals into metallic and
non-metallic luster. Minerals that are opaque and shiny, like pyrite, are said to have a “metallic” luster. Minerals
with a “non-metallic” luster do not look like metals. There are many types of non-metallic luster. Six are described
below ( Table 3.1).

Density describes how much matter is in a certain amount of space. Substances that have more matter packed into
a given space have higher densities. The water in a drinking glass has the same density as the water in a bathtub or
swimming pool. All substances have characteristic densities, which does not depend on how much of a substance
you have.
Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. The amount of space an object takes up is described by its
volume. The density of an object depends on its mass and its volume. Density can be calculated using the following
equation:

Density = Mass/Volume

Samples that are the same size but have different densities, will have different masses. Gold has a density of about
19 g/cm3. Pyrite has a density of only about 5 g/cm3. Quartz is even less dense than pyrite and has a density of 2.7
g/cm3. If you picked up a piece of pyrite and a piece of quartz that were the same size, the pyrite would seem almost
twice as heavy as the quartz.
Speciﬁc gravity is used to identify minerals. Speciﬁc gravity measures how heavy the mineral is relative to the same
volume of water.

Hardness

Hardness is a mineral’s ability to resist being scratched. Minerals that are not easily scratched are hard. You test
the hardness of a mineral by scratching its surface with a mineral of a known hardness. Mineralogists use the Mohs
Hardness Scale ( Table 3.2), as a reference for mineral hardness. The scale lists common minerals in order of their
relative hardness. You can use the minerals in the scale to test the hardness of an unknown mineral.

Mohs Hardness Scale

As you can see, diamond is a 10 on the Mohs Hardness Scale. Diamond is the hardest mineral; no other mineral can
scratch a diamond. Quartz is a 7. It can be scratched by topaz, corundum, and diamond. Quartz will scratch minerals
that have a lower number on the scale. Fluorite is one. Suppose you had a piece of pure gold. You ﬁnd that calcite
scratches the gold. Gypsum does not. Gypsum has a hardness of 2 and calcite is a 3. That means the hardness of
gold is between gypsum and calcite. So the hardness of gold is about 2.5 on the scale. A hardness of 2.5 means that
gold is a relatively soft mineral. It is only about as hard as your ﬁngernail.

Cleavage and Fracture

Chapter 3. Earth’s Materials and Crust

Different types of minerals break apart in their own way. Remember that all minerals are crystals. This means that
the atoms in a mineral are arranged in a repeating pattern. This pattern determines how a mineral will break. When
you break a mineral, you break chemical bonds. Because of the way the atoms are arranged, some bonds are weaker
than other bonds. A mineral is more likely to break where the bonds between the atoms are weaker.

Cleavage

Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along certain planes. When a mineral breaks along a plane, it makes
a smooth surface. Minerals with different crystal structures will break or cleave in different ways ( Figure 3.17).
Halite tends to form cubes with smooth surfaces. Mica tends to form sheets. Fluorite can form octahedrons.

FIGURE 3.17
Minerals with different crystal structures have a tendency to break along certain planes. (A) Halite breaks into
cubes. (B) Muscovite breaks into sheets. (C) Fluorite breaks into octagons.

Minerals can form various shapes. Polygons are pictured below ( Figure 3.18). The shapes form as the minerals are
broken along their cleavage planes. Cleavage planes determine how the crystals can be cut to make smooth surfaces.
People who cut gemstones follow cleavage planes. Diamonds and emeralds can be cut to make beautiful gemstones.

Fracture

Fracture describes how a mineral breaks without any pattern. A fracture is uneven. The surface is not smooth and
ﬂat. You can learn about a mineral from the way it fractures. If a mineral splinters like wood, it may be ﬁbrous.
Some minerals, such as quartz, fracture to form smooth, curved surfaces. Pictured below is a mineral that broke
forming a smooth, curved surface ( Figure 3.19).

Other Identifying Characteristics

Minerals have other properties that can be used for identiﬁcation. For example, a mineral’s shape may indicate its
crystal structure. Sometimes crystals are too small to see. Then a mineralogist may use a special instrument to ﬁnd
the crystal structure.

3.5 Mineral Formation

• Explain different ways in which minerals form.
• Distinguish lava from magma.

Can you watch minerals forming?
Sure! Some kids get crystal growing kits. They mix up a solution and evaporate off the water. Mineral crystals
are left behind. This is similar to the way halite and some other minerals form. These minerals evaporate from salt
water.

Mineral Formation

Minerals form in a variety of ways. Some minerals form from very hot ﬂuids. Some form from cool ﬂuids. Some
form when solid minerals rearrange.

Formation from Magma and Lava

You are on vacation at the beach. You take your ﬂip-ﬂops off so you can go swimming. The sand is so hot it hurts
your feet. You have to run to the water. Now imagine if it were hot enough for the sand to melt.
Some places inside Earth are so hot that rock melts. Melted rock inside the Earth is called magma. Magma can be
hotter than 1,000oC. When magma erupts onto Earth’s surface, it is known as lava ( Figure 3.20). Minerals form
when magma and lava cool. Some minerals crystallize at hotter temperatures. These minerals form ﬁrst. Other
minerals form at cooler temperatures. These minerals form later.

166

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Earth’s Materials and Crust

FIGURE 3.20
Lava is melted rock that erupts onto
Earth’s surface.

Formation from Solutions

Most water on Earth, like the water in the oceans, contains elements. The elements are mixed evenly through the
water. Water plus other substances makes a solution. The particles are so small that they will not come out when
you ﬁlter the water. But the elements in water can form solid mineral deposits.

Minerals from Salt Water

Fresh water contains a small amount of dissolved elements. Salt water contains many more dissolved elements.
Water can only hold a certain amount of dissolved substances. When the water evaporates, it leaves behind a solid
layer of minerals ( Figure 3.21). At this time, the particles come together to form minerals. These solids sink to the
bottom. The amount of mineral formed is the same as the amount dissolved in the water. Seawater is salty enough
for minerals to precipitate as solids. Some lakes, such as Mono Lake in California, or Utah’s Great Salt Lake, can
also precipitate salts.

FIGURE 3.21
When the water in glass A evaporates,
the dissolved mineral particles are left
behind.

Salt easily precipitates out of water, as does calcite ( Figure 3.22). The limestone towers pictured below are made
mostly of the mineral calcite. The calcite was deposited in the salty and alkaline water of Mono Lake, in California.
Calcium-rich spring water enters the bottom of the lake. The water bubbles up into the alkaline lake. The calcite
“tufa” towers form. When the lake level drops, the tufa towers are revealed.

167

3.5. Mineral Formation

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 3.22
Tufa towers are found in interesting forma-
tions at Mono Lake, California.

Minerals from Hot Underground Water

Underground water can be heated by magma. The hot water moves through cracks below Earth’s surface. Hot water
can hold more dissolved particles than cold water. The hot, salty solution has chemical reactions with the rocks
around it. The water picks up more dissolved particles. As it ﬂows through open spaces in rocks, the water deposits
solid minerals. When a mineral ﬁlls cracks in rocks, the deposits are called veins. Pictured below is a white quartz
vein ( Figure 3.23). When the minerals are deposited in open spaces, large crystals grow. These rocks are called
geodes. Pictured below is a geode that was formed when amethyst crystals grew in an open space in a rock ( Figure
3.23).

FIGURE 3.23
(A) A quartz vein formed in this rock. (B)
Geodes form when minerals evaporate
out in open spaces inside a rock.

Summary

• Minerals form as magma or lava cools.
• Minerals form when they precipitate from hot ﬂuids that have cooled down.
• Minerals form from dissolved substances when water evaporates.

3.6 Rocks

• Deﬁne rock.
• Describe the three major rock types.

Will this rock be there forever?
Rocks may seem permanent, but they’re not. Over time a rock will change into another type of rock. How this
happens is known as the rock cycle. There are three main types of rocks. There are several processes that can
change one type into another. First we need to learn what the rocks types and processes are.

What is a Rock?

A rock is a naturally formed, non-living Earth material. Rocks are made of minerals. The minerals may be so tiny
that you can only see them with a microscope. The minerals may be really large. A rock may be made of only one
type of mineral. More often rocks are made of a mixture of different minerals. A few types of rocks are made from
materials that are not minerals. For example, coal is organic so it is not a mineral, nor is it made of minerals. Yet
coal is a rock.
Rocks are named for the combinations of minerals they are made of and the ways those minerals came together.
Remember that different minerals form under different environmental conditions. So the minerals in a rock contain
clues about the conditions in which the rock formed ( Figure 3.24).

Rock Types

Geologists group rocks based on how they form. There are three major rock types. Each will be described in more
detail in the coming concepts.

• Igneous rocks form when magma cools below Earth’s surface or lava cools at the surface.

• Sedimentary rocks form when sediments are compacted and cemented together. Sediments are pieces of
rock. They may be gravel, sand, silt, or clay. Some sedimentary rocks form the solid minerals left behind after
a liquid evaporates.

• Metamorphic rocks form when an existing rock is changed by heat or pressure. The minerals in the rock

change but do not melt. The rock experiences these changes within the Earth.

Rocks can change from one type to another. The rock cycle describes how this happens.

Summary

• Nearly all rocks are made of minerals. A few are made of materials that do not ﬁt the deﬁnition of minerals.
• Igneous rocks form from cooled magma or lava.
• Metamorphic rocks form as an existing rock is altered by high temperature or pressure.
• Sedimentary rocks form from sediments that are cemented and compacted.

3.7 Igneous Rocks

• Describe igneous rocks.
• Explain igneous rock compositions.

Have you seen igneous rocks in the ﬁeld?
Igneous rocks are everywhere! One of the most common igneous rocks that make up the crust is granite. Many
mountain ranges are made of granite. The spectacular features of Yosemite Valley, like Half Dome, are granitic.
Volcanoes are made of igneous rocks, such as basalt.
Igneous rocks are also found where you can’t see them.
Oceanic crust is mostly basalt and gabbro. The mantle is peridotite.

Igneous Rocks

Igneous rocks form when magma cools and forms crystals. Magma is melted rock. What an igneous rock looks like
is determined by two things. One is the composition of the magma. The other is how fast the magma cools. The rate
of cooling determines the texture of the rock.

Composition

Different igneous rocks contain minerals with different compositions. Maﬁc igneous rocks contain maﬁc minerals.
Maﬁc minerals are dense and dark in color. They typically contain iron and magnesium; they are low in silica.
Olivine and pyroxene are maﬁc minerals.
Felsic igneous rocks contain felsic minerals. They typically contain aluminum and sodium; they are high in silica.
Quartz and potassium feldspar are felsic minerals. Minerals and rocks with a composition in between maﬁc and
felsic are called intermediate.

Summary

• Magma cools to form igneous rocks. Two factors determine what type of rock forms.
• The composition of the magma determines if the rock is maﬁc, felsic, or intermediate.
• The rate the magma cools determines the texture of the rock.

3.8 Intrusive and Extrusive Igneous Rocks

• Compare and contrast intrusive and extrusive igneous rock.

Are these both igneous rocks?
These rocks don’t even look like they’re the same type! They are, at least in the same way that ﬁsh and mice are
both vertebrates. They both cooled from magma, but the similarities end there. Can you tell what’s different?

Cooling

Igneous rocks cool from magma. The appearance of the rock is created by the composition of the magma. It is also
determined by the rate that the magma cools. If the magma cools deep underground, it cools slowly. If the magma
cools at or very near the surface, it cools quickly. This results in two different rock types. The rock types can be told
apart by the size of their crystals. The size of the crystals creates the texture of the rock.

Intrusive Igneous Rocks

Intrusive igneous rocks cool underground. Deep in the crust, magma cools slowly. Slow cooling gives crystals a
chance to grow. Intrusive igneous rocks have relatively large crystals that are easy to see. Intrusive igneous rocks
are also called plutonic. A pluton is an igneous rock body that forms within the crust.
Granite is the most common intrusive igneous rock. Pictured below are four types of intrusive rocks ( Figure 3.27).
Geological processes have brought some igneous rocks to the surface. Pictured below is a landscape in California’s
Sierra Nevada Mountains made of granite that has been raised to create mountains ( Figure 3.28).

Extrusive Igneous Rocks

Extrusive igneous rocks form above the surface. The lava cools quickly as it pours out onto the surface ( Figure
3.29). Extrusive igneous rocks cool much more rapidly than intrusive rocks. The rapid cooling time does not
allow time for large crystals to form. So igneous extrusive rocks have smaller crystals than igneous intrusive rocks.
Extrusive igneous rocks are also called volcanic rocks.
Some extrusive igneous rocks cool so rapidly that crystals do not develop at all. These form a glass, such as obsidian.
Others, such as pumice, contain holes where gas bubbles were trapped in the lava. The holes make pumice so light

3.9 Igneous Rock Classiﬁcation

• Explain how igneous rocks are classiﬁed by composition and by cooling rate.

Is this igneous rock intrusive or extrusive?
You can’t really tell from this view. A close up view would show small crystals in a dark colored rock. This indicates
rapid cooling from a basalt lava. The most interesting feature you can see are the hexagonal "posts." For them to
form, cooling must not have been too rapid. This amazing feature is Devil’s Tower in Wyoming.

Igneous Rock Classiﬁcation

Igneous rocks are classiﬁed by composition and texture. The composition can be felsic, intermediate, maﬁc, or
ultramaﬁc. The composition depends on the minerals the rock includes. A felsic rock will contain felsic minerals.
The mineral compositions are listed in the Table 3.4. The table includes examples of minerals.

Texture indicates how the magma cooled. Magma that cools rapidly has small or no visible crystals. Magma that
cools slowly has large crystals; reference the Table 3.4 for the type of rock, the amount of silica it has, and examples.

Pictured above are two pairs of igneous rocks ( Figures 3.31 and 3.32). The ﬁrst pair is two rocks that formed from
a felsic magma. The rhyolite cooled rapidly, and the granite cooled slowly. The second pair is two rocks that formed
from maﬁc magma. The basalt cooled rapidly, and the gabbro cooled slowly. The color of the rocks and sizes of the
crystals are your clues. There are other rock pairs that you could ﬁnd listed below ( Table 3.5).

Summary

• Igneous rocks are classiﬁed ﬁrst by composition. Categories go from from felsic to ultramaﬁc. Color can

indicate composition.

• Texture is second when classifying igneous rocks. Texture indicates how a rock cooled.
• Igneous rocks are categorized in pairs. The two rocks in a pair have the same composition but different

textures: gabbro-basalt, diorite-andesite, and granite-rhyolite.

3.10 Sedimentary Rocks

• Describe sediments.
• Describe how sediments become sedimentary rocks.

Where can you go to see sediments?
Sediments are everywhere! One of the most fun places to see sediments is on a beach. Squishing sand between your
toes is a great way to experience sediments ﬁrst hand (or foot).

Sedimentary Rocks

Most sedimentary rocks form from sediments. The sediments must be packed together to form a rock. Sedimentary
rocks also form as minerals precipitate from saline water. Sedimentary rock formation is described in the next
concept.

Sediments

Sediments are small fragments of rocks and minerals. Pebbles, sand, silt, and clay are examples of sediments.
Sedimentary rocks may include fossils. Fossils are materials left behind by once-living organisms. Fossils can be
pieces of the organism, like bones. They can also be traces of the organism, like footprints.

3.10. Sedimentary Rocks

Transport

www.ck12.org

Sediments are transported by water, wind, ice, or gravity. These agents move them from the place where they
formed. The sediments are then deposited in a location.

Deposition

Sediments will eventually settle out of water ( Figure 3.33). For example, rivers carry lots of sediment. Where the
water slows, it dumps these sediments along its banks, into lakes and the ocean.

FIGURE 3.33
Cobbles, pebbles, and sands are the sediments that are seen on this
beach.

When sediments settle out of water, they form horizontal layers. A layer of sediment is deposited. Then the next
layer is deposited on top of that layer. So each layer in a sedimentary rock is younger than the layer under it ( Figure
3.34).

FIGURE 3.34
The rock layers at the Grand Canyon are horizontal. We know that layers
at the bottom are older than layers at the top.

Sediments are deposited in many different types of environments. Beaches and deserts collect large deposits
of sand. Sediments also end up at the bottom of the ocean and in lakes, ponds, rivers, marshes, and swamps.
Avalanches produce large piles of sediment. The environment where the sediments are deposited determines the
type of sedimentary rock that can form.

Summary

• Sediments are small fragments of minerals, rocks, or fossils.
• Sediments range in size from tiny bits of silt or clay to enormous boulders.
• Sediments are deposited in many different environments.

3.11 Lithiﬁcation of Sedimentary Rocks

• Explain how sediments become rock.
• Distinguish clastic and chemical sedimentary rocks.

What steps led to this rock formation?
What do you see? The rock is a sandstone, so ﬁrst there were rocks that weathered and eroded. The cross-bedding
indicates that the sand was deposited in a dune. The sand was then buried deeply enough that it turned into rock.
This concept will explore how something like sand could become a rock.

Sedimentary Rock Formation

There are two main types of sedimentary rocks: clastic and chemical. Clastic rocks are made of sediments, which
are sometimes called clasts. Creating rocks from sediments is called lithiﬁcation. Chemicals precipitate from liquid
to form chemical sedimentary rocks.

Clastic Rocks

Over time, deposited sediments may harden into rock. First, the sediments are compacted. That is, they are squeezed
together by the weight of sediments on top of them. Next, the sediments are cemented together. Minerals ﬁll in the
spaces between the loose sediment particles. These cementing minerals come from the water that moves through the
sediments. Sedimentary rocks that form from sediments are called “clastic rocks.“ Clastic rocks are rock fragments
that are compacted and cemented together ( Figure 3.35).

Chapter 3. Earth’s Materials and Crust

FIGURE 3.35
Conglomerates have larger clasts than sandstone, which have larger clasts than mudstone.

Chemical Sedimentary Rocks

Chemical sedimentary rocks form when crystals precipitate out from a liquid. The mineral halite, also called rock
salt, forms this way. You can make halite! Leave a shallow dish of salt water out in the Sun. As the water evaporates,
salt crystals form in the dish. There are other chemical sedimentary rocks, like gypsum ( Figure 3.36).

FIGURE 3.36
Gypsum, with its rose-like structure, is a chemical sedimentary rock.

Summary

• Compaction and cementation lead to lithiﬁcation of sedimentary rocks.
• Sediments are compacted by the weight of the rocks and sediments above them.
• Sediments are cemented by ﬂuids that bind sediments together.
• Minerals precipitate to form sedimentary rocks.

3.12 Sedimentary Rock Classiﬁcation

• Describe how sedimentary rocks are classiﬁed.
• List some common sedimentary rocks.

Can you tell which type of rock these are?
If you look up close, you would be able to see grains of sand. From this distance, you can see different layers from
where the sand was laid down. This rock is sandstone. The sand grains are cemented together to make sandstone.
Sandstone is a common type of sedimentary rock.

Types of Sedimentary Rocks

The main types of sedimentary rocks are clastic or chemical. Some sedimentary rocks are a third type, organic.
Clastic sedimentary rocks are made of sediments. The sediments differ in size. Chemical sedimentary rocks are made
of minerals that precipitate from saline water. Organic sedimentary rocks are made from the bodies of organisms.

Clastic Sedimentary Rocks

Clastic sedimentary rocks are grouped by the size of the sediment they contain. Conglomerate and breccia are
made of individual stones that have been cemented together. In conglomerate, the stones are rounded. In breccia, the
stones are angular. Sandstone is made of sand-sized particles. Siltstone is made of smaller particles. Silt is smaller
than sand but larger than clay. Shale has the smallest grain size. Shale is made mostly of clay-sized particles and
hardened mud.

When sediments settle out of calmer water, they form horizontal layers. One layer is deposited ﬁrst, and another
layer is deposited on top of it. So each layer is younger than the layer beneath it. When the sediments harden, the

189

3.12. Sedimentary Rock Classiﬁcation

www.ck12.org

layers are preserved.

Chemical Sedimentary Rocks

Sedimentary rocks formed by the crystallization of chemical precipitates are called chemical sedimentary rocks.
Dissolved ions in ﬂuids precipitate out of the ﬂuid and settle out, just like the halite pictured below ( Figure 3.37).

FIGURE 3.37
The evaporite, halite, on a cobble from the Dead Sea, Israel.

Living creatures can help chemicals become sedimentary rocks. Limestone is an example.

Organic Sedimentary Rocks

The bodies of organisms can make a sedimentary rock. Plant bodies are lithiﬁed to become coal. When shells are
cemented together they make a type of limestone. So limestone can be considered chemical or organic.

3.13. Metamorphic Rocks

www.ck12.org

3.13 Metamorphic Rocks

• Explain how metamorphic rocks form.

What is the history of this rock?
The rock in this photo is a banded gneiss. The bands are made of different minerals. The light bands are more felsic,
and the dark bands are more maﬁc. The minerals separated due to heat and pressure. The waviness of the bands also
shows how the rock was hot enough to alter. It was not hot enough to melt all the way.

Metamorphism

Metamorphic rocks start off as some kind of rock. The starting rock can be igneous, sedimentary, or even another
metamorphic rock. Heat and/or pressure then change the rock into a metamorphic rock. The change can be physical,
chemical, or both.
During metamorphism, a rock may change chemically. Ions move in or out of a mineral. This creates a different
mineral. The new minerals that form during metamorphism are more stable in the new environment. Extreme
pressure may lead to physical changes. If pressure is exerted on the rock from one direction, the rock forms layers.
This is foliation. If pressure is exerted from all directions, the rock usually does not show foliation.
There are two main types of metamorphism: contact and regional.

Contact Metamorphism

Contact metamorphism results when magma contacts a rock. The rock changes because of the magma’s extreme
heat ( Figure 3.38).

194

Chapter 3. Earth’s Materials and Crust

FIGURE 3.38
(A) Hornfels is a rock that is created by
contact metamorphism.
(B) Hornfels is
so hard that it can create peaks like the
Rocky Mountains.

Regional Metamorphism

Regional metamorphism occurs over a wide area. Great masses of rock are exposed to pressure from rock and
sediment layers on top of it. The rock may also be compressed by other geological processes. If the rock is buried
deeply, it may experience high temperatures.

FIGURE 3.39
(A) Regional metamorphic rocks often
display layering called foliation.
(B)
Regional metamorphism with high pres-
sures and low temperatures can result in
blueschist.

Metamorphism does not cause a rock to melt completely. It only causes the minerals to change by heat or pressure.
If the rock melts completely, it will cool to become an igneous rock.
Hornfels is a rock with alternating bands of dark and light crystals. Hornfels is a good example of how minerals
rearrange themselves during metamorphism ( Figure 3.39). The minerals in hornfels separate by density. The result
is that the rock becomes banded. Gneiss forms by regional metamorphism from extremely high temperature and
pressure.

Summary

• Any type of rock—igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic—can become a metamorphic rock.
• Contact metamorphism occurs when a rock is altered by heat from a nearby magma.
• Regional metamorphism occurs over a large area when a rock is buried or compressed.

The rock on the left was the sedimentary rock shale. Now it’s the metamorphic rock slate. Slate looks very similar
to shale, but harder and more platy. The rock on the right is gneiss. The light and dark minerals have separated into
bands. Gneiss is produced by higher temperature metamorphism. The original rock was different in both cases.

3.15 Rocks and Processes of the Rock Cycle

• Explain the processes of the rock cycle.

Is this what geologists mean by the rock cycle?
Okay, maybe not. The rock cycle shows how any type of rock can become any other type of rock. The three rock
types are joined together by the processes that change one to another.

The Rock Cycle

You learned about the three rock types: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. You also learned that all of these
rocks can change. In fact, any rock can change to become any other type of rock. These changes usually happen
very slowly. Some changes happen below Earth’s surface. Some changes happen above ground. These changes are
all part of the rock cycle. The rock cycle describes each of the main types of rocks, how they form, and how they
change.
The ﬁgure below shows how the three main rock types are related to each other ( Figure 3.40). The arrows within
the circle show how one type of rock may change to rock of another type. These are the processes that change one
rock type to another rock type.

200

www.ck12.org

Chapter 3. Earth’s Materials and Crust

FIGURE 3.40
The Rock Cycle.

Processes of the Rock Cycle

There are three main processes that can change rock:

• Cooling and crystallization. Deep within the Earth, temperatures can get hot enough to create magma. As
magma cools, crystals grow, forming an igneous rock. The crystals grow larger if the magma cools slowly, as
it does if it remains deep within the Earth. If the magma cools quickly, the crystals will be very small. When
crystals form from magma it is called crystallization.

• Weathering and erosion. Water, wind, ice, and even plants and animals all act to wear down rocks. Over time
they can break larger rocks into sediments. Rocks break down by the process called weathering. Moving
water, wind, and glaciers then carry these pieces from one place to another. This is called erosion. The
sediments are eventually dropped, or deposited, somewhere. This process is called sedimentation. The
sediments may then be compacted and cemented together. This forms a sedimentary rock. This whole process
can take hundreds or thousands of years.

• Metamorphism. This long word means “to change form.“ A rock undergoes metamorphism if it is exposed to
extreme heat and pressure within the crust. With metamorphism, the rock does not melt all the way. The rock
changes due to heat and pressure. A metamorphic rock may have a new mineral composition and/or texture.

An interactive rock cycle diagram can be found here: http://www.classzone.com/books/earth_science/terc/content/in
vestigations/es0602/es0602page02.cfm?chapter_no=investigation
The rock cycle really has no beginning or end. It just continues. The processes involved in the rock cycle take place
over hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years. Even though for us rocks are solid and unchanging, they slowly
change all the time.

Summary

• The three main rock types are igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary.

Summary

All matter is made of tiny particles. Protons, neutrons, and electrons form atoms that bond together to create
molecules. Atoms are the smallest units that have the properties of an element. Molecules are the smallest units of a
compound. Chemical bonds hold molecules together. Molecules form the different types of minerals. The silicates
make up most of Earth’s crust. Minerals come together to create the three major rock types. They are igneous,
sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks form from cooled magma. Sedimentary rocks form from compacted
or cemented sediments. Metamorphic rocks are those that have been altered by heat and pressure. These three rock
types are the material part of the rock cycle. They are connected by different processes. Different processes convert
any type of rock into any other type of rock. These processes are weathering and erosion, crystallization, and burial
and pressure, among others. Each rock contains a story of how it formed. For most rocks it is possible to know what
it formed from.

Is the theory of plate tectonics an example of how a theory comes to be?
Scientiﬁc ideas do not come to a scientist fully formed. They usually start as observations. Somewhere along the way
the scientist develops a hypothesis. The scientist ﬁnds evidence to support or refute the hypothesis. If the evidence is
in support, the idea evolves into something bigger. By the time an idea is a theory it is extremely complex. A theory
has a tremendous amount of data to support it. Nothing substantial refutes it. It probably is extremely important in
the area it addresses. Plate tectonics provides a tremendous example of how a theory comes to be. In this section we
will follow the development of the theory of plate tectonics. It begins as an observation on how South America and
Africa ﬁt together. And becomes the framework on which much of geology hangs.

4.1 Continental Drift

• Identify the evidence Wegener had in support of his continental drift hypothesis.
• Apply the steps of scientiﬁc method to Wegener’s scientiﬁc investigation.

What does a scientist do with an interesting observation?
Alfred Wegener made an observation. From that observation, he made a hypothesis. He collected evidence that
would support or refute his hypothesis. What did that process look like?

Wegener’s Idea

Alfred Wegener, born in 1880, was a meteorologist and explorer. In 1910, he noticed that South America and Africa
appeared to ﬁt together like puzzle pieces. He was certainly not the ﬁrst person to notice this. But he was intrigued
by the idea and thought a lot about it. He wondered if the two continents were once joined and then moved apart?
He set out to ﬁnd evidence to support or refute this idea.

Wegener’s Evidence

Here is the main evidence that Wegener and his supporters collected for his continental drift hypothesis:

207

4.1. Continental Drift

Fit of the Continents

www.ck12.org

The continents appear to ﬁt together, and not just South America and Africa. If the continental margins are included,
the ﬁt is even better.

FIGURE 4.1
This ﬁgure shows the evolution of the continents, from the super-continent Pangaea to the way they look now.

Distribution of Fossils

Wegener found fossil evidence that the continents were once joined ( Figure 4.2). The same type of plant and animal
fossils are found on continents that are now widely separated. These organisms would not have been able to travel
across the oceans. So how did the fossils get so far apart?
Fossils of the seed fern Glossopteris are found across all of the southern continents. These seeds are too heavy to
be carried across the ocean by wind. Mesosaurus fossils are found in South America and South Africa. Mesosaurus
could swim, but only in fresh water. Cynognathus and Lystrosaurus were reptiles that lived on land. Both of
these animals were unable to swim at all. Their fossils have been found across South America, Africa, India, and
Antarctica.
Wegener thought that all of these organisms must have lived side by side. The lands later moved apart so that the
fossils are separated.

Distribution of Rocks and Structures

Wegener found rocks of the same type and age on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. He thought that it could not
be a coincidence! He said that the rocks must have formed side by side. These rocks then drifted apart on separate
continents.
Wegener also matched up mountain ranges across the Atlantic Ocean. The Appalachian Mountains were just like
mountain ranges in eastern Greenland, Ireland, Great Britain, and Norway. Wegener concluded that they formed as
a single mountain range. This mountain range broke apart as the continents split up. The mountain range separated
as the continents drifted.

208

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Plate Tectonics

FIGURE 4.2
Wegener used fossil evidence to sup-
port his continental drift hypothesis. The
fossils of these organisms are found on
lands that are now far apart. Wegener
suggested that when the organisms were
alive, the lands were joined and the or-
ganisms were living side-by-side.

Climate Zones

Climate is found in zones around the planet. Warm tropical climates are mostly found near the Equator. Glaciers are
mostly found nearer the poles. Wegener assumed that these things were true in the ancient past.

Glaciers

Wegener looked at evidence from ancient glaciers. Glaciers are found in very cold climates near the poles. The
evidence left by some ancient glaciers is very close to the Equator. Did glaciers once exist near the poles? Wegener
knew that this was extremely unlikely! However, if the continents had moved, the glaciers would have been centered
close to the South Pole.

Tropics

Coral reefs are found only in warm water. Coal swamps are also found in tropical and subtropical environments.
Wegener discovered ancient coal seams and coral reef fossils in areas that are much too cold today. Wegener thought
that ancient coral and coal plants existed at about the same latitude where they are found today. He again stated
that it was the continents that moved. An animation showing that Earth’s climate belts remain in roughly the same
position while the continents move is seen here: http://www.scotese.com/paleocli.htm .
An animation showing how the continents split up can be found here: http://www.exploratorium.edu/origins/antarct
ica/ideas/gondwana2.html .

Summary

• Alfred Wegener made an observation. Africa and South America appeared to ﬁt together like puzzle pieces.
• Wegener then asked an important question and set about to answer it. Were the continents once joined and

then they drifted apart?

209

4.1. Continental Drift

www.ck12.org

• Wegener collected a great deal of evidence to support his idea. Wegener’s evidence included the ﬁt of the
continents, the distribution of ancient fossils, the placement of similar rocks and structures on the opposite
sides of oceans, and indicators of ancient climate found in locations where those climates do not exist today.

4.2 Wegener and the Continental Drift Hypoth-

esis

• Deﬁne the continental drift hypothesis.
• Describe issues with the continental drift hypothesis.

What is continental drift?
Wegener put together a tremendous amount of evidence that the continents had been joined. He advanced a great
idea. But other scientists didn’t accept it.

Wegener’s Continental Drift Hypothesis

Wegener put his idea and his evidence together in his book, The Origin of Continents and Oceans. The book was ﬁrst
published in 1915. He included evidence that the continents had been joined. New editions of the book containing

211

4.2. Wegener and the Continental Drift Hypothesis

www.ck12.org

additional evidence were published later.
In his book he said that around 300 million years ago, the continents had all been joined. They created a single
landmass he called Pangaea, meaning “all earth” in ancient Greek. The supercontinent later broke apart. Since then
the continents have been moving into their current positions. He called his hypothesis continental drift.

The Problem with the Hypothesis

Wegener had a lot of evidence to support his hypothesis. But he had a problem. The problem was that he could
not explain how the continents could move through the oceans. He suggested that continental drift occurred like an
icebreaker plows through sea ice ( Figure 4.3). He thought the continents could cut through the ocean ﬂoor.

FIGURE 4.3
An icebreaking ship.

Other scientists didn’t buy his idea. They thought that the continents would be much more deformed than they are.
Wegener believed that Africa and South America had once been joined. He had the evidence. But very few scientists
accepted his idea. He needed a mechanism that they would accept.
Alfred Wegener died in 1930 on an expedition on the Greenland icecap. The continental drift hypothesis was put to
rest for a few decades. It was when technology could provide even more evidence for continental drift that scientists
looked into the idea again. Technology also helped scientists to develop a mechanism for how continents could drift.

Summary

• Alfred Wegener said that the continents had been joined as a single landmass, which he called Pangaea.
• Wegener thought that Pangaea was together about 300 million years ago.
• Wegener could not develop a mechanism for continents moving through oceanic crust that other scientists

would accept.

4.3 Magnetic Polarity Evidence for Continental

Drift

• Summarize magnetic polarity.
• Identify how magnetic polarity evidence supports continental drift.

How did technology play a role in developing Wegener’s idea?
After Wegener’s death, the continental drift idea was pretty much dead. It would have remained that way except for
the development of technology. Using technology, scientists would ﬁnd more evidence that continents had drifted.
They would also be able to ﬁnd the mechanism. This type of magnetometer was one of their important tools.

214

www.ck12.org

Magnetic Polarity

Chapter 4. Plate Tectonics

Some important evidence for continental drift came after Wegener’s death. The following is the magnetic evidence:
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld surrounds the planet from pole to pole. If you have ever been hiking or camping, you may
have used a compass to help you ﬁnd your way. A compass points to the magnetic North Pole. The compass needle
aligns with Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld.
Some rocks contain little compasses too! As lava cools, tiny iron-rich crystals line up with Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld.
These crystals are magnetite crystals. Anywhere lavas have cooled, these magnetite crystals point to the magnetic
poles. The little magnets point to where the North Pole was when the lava cooled. A magnetometer is a device
capable of measuring the magnetic ﬁeld. A magnetometer can be used on land. A magnetometer also can be dragged
behind a ship.

Evidence for Continental Drift

Geologists used magnetometers to look at rocks on land. They wanted to know which direction magnetite crystals
pointed. This would tell them where magnetic north was at the time the rocks cooled. This is what they learned:

• Magnetite crystals in fresh volcanic rocks point to the current magnetic north pole ( Figure 4.4).

FIGURE 4.4
Earth’s current north magnetic pole is in
northern Canada.

• Older rocks that are the same age and are on the same continent point to the same location. However, the

location they point to is not the current north magnetic pole.

• Older rocks that are different ages and are on the same continent do not point to the same location. None of

them point to the current magnetic north pole.

• Rocks on different continents that are the same age point to different locations. Only recent rocks point to the

current north magnetic pole.

How did the geologists explain this? There is only one logical explanation. There was almost certainly only one
north magnetic pole through Earth’s history. The north magnetic pole is very likely in the same spot it has always
been. If these two things are true, then the continents have moved.

215

4.3. Magnetic Polarity Evidence for Continental Drift

www.ck12.org

Support for Wegener’s Idea

Geologist tested the idea that the pole remained ﬁxed but the continents moved. They ﬁtted the continents together
as Wegener had done. They moved them into the positions where they had been at the time the magnetite crystals
cooled. The magnetite crystals pointed to the current north magnetic pole ( Figure 4.5). The magnetic pole seemed
to have moved, but had not. They named the phenomenon apparent polar wander.

FIGURE 4.5
On the left: The apparent North Pole for Europe and North America if the continents were always in their current
locations. The two paths merge into one if the continents are allowed to drift.

Geologists were now more interested in continental drift. More than ever, they needed a mechanism.

Summary

• Magnetite is a magnetic mineral found in lava. The magnetite points to the magnetic north pole when it cools.
• Scientists used magnetometers to show where the north magnetic pole had been when magnetite crystals

cooled.

• Magnetite crystals of different ages and on different continents pointed to different spots. The simplest

explanation is that the continents have moved.

• Apparent polar wander is another line of evidence for drifting continents.

4.4 Bathymetric Evidence for Seaﬂoor Spread-

ing

• Describe how echosounders can be used to create bathymetric maps.
• Identify features of the seaﬂoor.

How can war further science?
Oddly, the thing that was needed to further Wegener’s continental drift idea was World War II. U.S. Navy ships
cruised the seas. They carried instruments that helped scientists to locate the mechanism for moving continents.

Echo Sounders

During World War II, battleships and submarines carried echo sounders. Their goal was to locate enemy submarines
( Figure 4.6). Echo sounders produce sound waves that travel outward in all directions. The sound waves bounce
off the nearest object and then return to the ship. Scientists know the speed of sound in seawater. They then can
calculate the distance to the object that the sound wave hit. Most of these sound waves did not hit submarines. They
instead were used to map the ocean ﬂoor.

Features of the Seaﬂoor

Scientists expected the seaﬂoor to be ﬂat and featureless. So they were shocked by what they saw: tremendous
topographical features like mountain ranges, rifts, and trenches. Oceanographic research vessels continue to map
the seaﬂoor as they sail across the seas today. The map below is a modern map with data from several decades.
The major features of the ocean basins and their colors on the map include:

• mid-ocean ridges: A long chain of mountains that rises up high above the deep seaﬂoor. An example is the

light blue gash in middle of Atlantic Ocean. Light blue is higher elevation than dark blue.

218

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Plate Tectonics

FIGURE 4.6
A ship sends out sound waves to create a picture of the seaﬂoor below
it. The echo sounder pictured has many beams, and, as a result, it
creates a three dimensional map of the seaﬂoor beneath the ship. Early
echo sounders had only a single beam and created a line of depth
measurements.

• rift zones: In the middle of the mid-ocean ridges is a rift zone. The rift cuts the ridge into pieces. It is lower in

elevation than the mountains of the mid-ocean ridge.

• deep sea trenches: Trenches are found in the sea. Some are near the edges of continents. Trenches are found
near chains of active volcanoes. An example is the line of the very deepest blue, off of western South America.
• abyssal plains: Flat areas that may be dotted with volcanic mountains. An example is the consistent blue off

of southeastern South America.

• guyots: Flat topped mountains that appear to have been eroded. Yet these mountains are thousands of feet

below sea level.

• continental margin: The transition from the land to the deep sea. The continental margin is made of

continental crust. More than one-quarter of the ocean basin is continental margin.

See if you can identify each of these features on the map (( Figure 4.7)) below.

FIGURE 4.7
A modern map of the southeastern Paciﬁc and Atlantic Oceans.

Of course the ﬁrst scientists to observe these features wondered how they had formed. It turns out that they were
crucial for ﬁtting together ideas about seaﬂoor spreading. And seaﬂoor spreading would turn out to be the mechanism
for continental drift.

Summary

• Echo sounders were used to search for enemy submarines during World War II. The depths they recorded
allowed scientists to piece together bathymetric maps of the seaﬂoor. Multi-beam sounders work on research
vessels today.

• These maps revealed amazing features like mid-ocean ridges, deep-sea trenches, and abyssal plains.
• The features of the seaﬂoor helped scientists to discover the mechanism for continental drift.

4.5 Magnetic Evidence for Seaﬂoor Spreading

• Explain the pattern of magnetic stripes on the seaﬂoor.
• Distinguish normal polarity from reversed polarity.

What causes the strange stripes on the seaﬂoor?
Magnetometers in the oceans discovered strange patterns. This pattern of stripes is like what they discovered on the
seaﬂoor. In this image, there is a dusky purple stripe in the center. Other colored stripes are symmetrical about the
dusky purple stripe. In the oceans, magnetic stripes are symmetrical about a mid-ocean ridge axis. What does this
have to do with continental drift?

Seaﬂoor Magnetism

Warships also carried magnetometers. Like the echo sounders, the magnetometers were used to search for sub-
marines. The magnetometers also revealed a lot about the magnetic properties of the seaﬂoor.

221

4.5. Magnetic Evidence for Seaﬂoor Spreading

www.ck12.org

Polar Reversals

Looking at the magnetism of the seaﬂoor, scientists discovered something astonishing. Many times in Earth’s history,
the magnetic poles have switched positions. North becomes south, and south becomes north! When the north and
south poles are aligned as they are now, geologists say it is normal polarity. When they are in the opposite position,
they say that it is reversed polarity.

Magnetic Stripes

Scientists were even more surprised to discover a pattern of magnetism on the seaﬂoor. There are stripes with
different magnetism. Some stripes have normal polarity and some have reversed polarity. These stripes surround the
mid-ocean ridges. There is one long stripe with normal magnetism at the top of the ridge. Next to that stripe are
two long stripes with reversed magnetism. One is on either side of the normal stripe. Next come two normal stripes
and then two reversed stripes, and so on across the ocean ﬂoor. The magnetic stripes end abruptly at the edges of
continents. Sometimes the stripes end at a deep sea trench ( Figure 4.8).

FIGURE 4.8
Scientists found that magnetic polarity in
the seaﬂoor was normal at mid-ocean
ridges but reversed in symmetrical pat-
terns away from the ridge center. This
normal and reversed pattern continues
across the seaﬂoor.

Magnetometers are still towed behind research ships. They continue to map the magnetism of the seaﬂoor.

Seaﬂoor Ages

Different seaﬂoor magnetic stripes equal different ages. By using geologic dating techniques, scientists could ﬁgure
out what these ages are. They found that the youngest rocks on the seaﬂoor were at the mid-ocean ridges. The rocks
get older with distance from the ridge crest. Scientists were surprised to ﬁnd that the oldest seaﬂoor is less than 180
million years old. This may seem old, but the oldest continental crust is around 4 billion years old.
Scientists discovered another way to tell the approximate age of seaﬂoor rocks. The rocks at the mid-ocean ridge
crest are nearly sediment free. The crust is also very thin there. With distance from the ridge crest, the sediments
and crust get thicker. This also supports the idea that the youngest rocks are on the ridge axis, and that the rocks get
older with distance away from the ridge ( Figure 4.9). This is because the crust is new at the ridge, and so it is thin
and has no sediment. The crust gets older away from the ridge crest. It has cooled and has more sediment.
This leads to an important idea: some process is creating seaﬂoor at the ridge crest. Somehow the older seaﬂoor is
being destroyed. Finally, we get to the mechanism for continental drift.

Summary

• Data from magnetometers dragged behind ships looking for enemy submarines in WWII discovered amazing

magnetic patterns on the seaﬂoor.

• The magnetic pole reverses from time to time. The north pole becomes the south pole, and the south pole

becomes the north pole.

• Rocks of normal and reversed polarity are found in stripes symmetrically about the mid-ocean ridge axis.
• The seaﬂoor is youngest at the ridge crest and oldest far away from the ridge crest. The oldest seaﬂoor rocks

are about 180 million years, much younger than the oldest continental rocks.

4.6 Seaﬂoor Spreading Hypothesis

• Outline the seaﬂoor spreading hypothesis
• Describe how seaﬂoor spreading works.

How do the continents move?
Harry Hess was a geology professor and a naval ofﬁcer. He commanded an attack transport ship during WWII. Hess
was intrigued by the seaﬂoor maps produced with the ship’s echo sounder. He thought about all of the evidence
for continental drift. He thought about all of the unusual features of the seaﬂoor. And he found the mechanism to
explain them all.

The Evidence Comes Together

World War II allowed scientists to make some puzzling observations. The observations came from seaﬂoor bathymetry
and magnetism. These observations are:

225

4.6. Seaﬂoor Spreading Hypothesis

www.ck12.org

• The seaﬂoor has a large mountain range running through it. Deep trenches are found far from the ridges.

Guyots have eroded tops that are deep below sea level.

• The magnetic polarity of the seaﬂoor changes. The center of the ridge is of normal polarity. Stripes of normal

and reverse polarity are found symmetrical on both sides of the ridge.

• The youngest seaﬂoor is at the ridge. The oldest is farthest from the ridge. The oldest seaﬂoor is much younger

than the oldest continent.

Scientists needed to explain these observations.

Mantle Convection

Not long after Wegener’s death, scientists recognized that there is convection in the mantle. Deeper material is
hotter and so it rises. Near the surface, it becomes cooler and denser so it sinks. This creates a convection cell in the
mantle.

Seaﬂoor Spreading

After the war, Harry Hess put together the ideas and evidence he needed. Hess resurrected Wegener’s continental
drift hypothesis. He reviewed the mantle convection idea. He thought about the bathymetric features and the patterns
of magnetic polarity on the seaﬂoor. In 1962, Hess published a new idea that he called seaﬂoor spreading.
Hess wrote that hot magma rises up into the rift valley at the mid-ocean ridges. The lava cools to form new seaﬂoor.
Later more lava erupts at the ridge. The new lava pushes the seaﬂoor horizontally away from the ridge axis ( Figure
4.10). The seaﬂoor moves!
Magnetite crystals in the lava point in the direction of the magnetic north pole. The different stripes of magnetic
polarity reveal the different ages of the seaﬂoor.
In some places, the oceanic crust comes up to a continent. The moving crust pushes that continent away from the
ridge axis as well. If the moving oceanic crust reaches a deep sea trench, the crust sinks into the mantle. The creation
and destruction of oceanic crust is the reason that continents move.

• As oceanic crust moves away from the ridge crest, it pushes a continent away from the ridge axis.
• If the oceanic crust reaches a deep sea trench, it sinks into the trench.
• The oldest crust is coldest and lies deepest in the ocean.

Chapter 4. Plate Tectonics

The ﬂat topped guyots were once active volcanoes that were above sea level. They were eroded at their tops. As the
seaﬂoor moved away from the ridge, the crust sank deeper. The tops of the guyots went below sea level.

The Mechanism for Continental Drift

Seaﬂoor spreading is the mechanism that Wegener was looking for! Convection currents within the mantle drive the
continents. The continents are pushed by oceanic crust, like they are on a conveyor belt. Over millions of years the
continents move around the planet’s surface. The spreading plate takes along any continent that rides on it.

Summary

• Seaﬂoor spreading is a mixture different ideas and data. Continental drift and mantle convection are supported

by bathymetric and magnetic data from the seaﬂoor.

• Harry Hess called his idea “an essay in geopoetry." This could be because so many ideas ﬁt together so well.

It could also be because, at the time, he didn’t have all the seaﬂoor data he needed for evidence.

• Seaﬂoor spreading is the mechanism for the drifting continents.

4.7 Earth’s Tectonic Plates

• Deﬁne plate.
• Describe lithospheric plates.

What do you get when you combine continental drift and seaﬂoor spreading?
Plate tectonics! In the next two concepts, we will analyze those words. What is a plate? What is tectonics? Then we
put it together. Alfred Wegener, who died on the Greenland ice sheet at the age of 50, didn’t live to.

What is a Plate?

What portion of Earth makes up the “plates” in plate tectonics? Again, the answer came about in part due to war. In
this case, the Cold War. The scientists set up seismometer networks during the 1950s and early 1960s. The purpose

228

www.ck12.org

Chapter 4. Plate Tectonics

was to see if other nations were testing atomic bombs. Since seismometers measure ground shaking, they also
recorded earthquakes.

Using Earthquakes

The seismographs located earthquake epicenters. The epicenter is the point on Earth’s surface directly above the
place where an earthquake occurs.
When earthquake epicenters are put on a map, they outline the plates. This is because the earthquakes where
the plates come into contact with each other. Earthquakes are found primarily in lines around the edges of some
continents. They are also found through the centers of some oceans. Some occur in patches in some land areas.

Lithospheric Plates

If you look at the map pictured below, you will see that the lithosphere is divided into plates ( Figure 4.11). There
are a dozen major and several minor plates. Each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains. Some
plates are made of all oceanic lithosphere. A few are all continental lithosphere. But most plates are made of a
combination of both. Notice the locations where the most earthquake epicenters are found.

FIGURE 4.11
A map of earthquake epicenters. The
outlines of the lithospheric plates can be
seen.

Plates of lithosphere sink into the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere, which is part of the upper mantle, is solid but
can ﬂow. If a weight is added to a plate, like a glacier, the plate will sink into the mantle. If the weight is taken away,
like when the glacier melts, the plate will rise. This happens slowly over long periods of time.

Summary

• A plate is a large chunk of lithosphere. There are a dozen major plates and several minor plates.
• A plate can carry continental crust, oceanic crust, or some of each.
• Plates can be identiﬁed by the locations of earthquake epicenters.

4.8 Tectonic Plate Motions

• Describe how plates move.
• Explain a convection cell.
• Describe seaﬂoor spreading.

What is tectonics?
Dividing the lithosphere into plates is one thing. Having the plates move around on the planet is another! A conveyor
belt is a good analogy for how a plate moves. How the plates move and where they move is the "tectonics" part of
plate tectonics.

Plate Motions

Scientists have determined the direction that each plate is moving ( Figure 4.12). Plates move around the Earth’s
surface at a rate of a few centimeters a year. This is about the same rate that ﬁngernails grow.

How Plates Move

Convection within the Earth’s mantle causes the plates to move. Mantle material is heated above the core. The hot
mantle rises up toward the surface ( Figure 4.13). As the mantle rises, it cools. At the surface, the material moves
horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. The material continues to cool. It sinks back down into the mantle
at a deep sea trench. The material sinks back down to the core. It moves horizontally again, completing a convection
cell.
Seaﬂoor spreading takes place as plates move apart from each other at a mid-ocean ridge. Mantle convection drives
seaﬂoor spreading.

mantle at
the mid-ocean ridge pushes
plates outward. Cold lithosphere sinking
into the mantle at a subduction zone pulls
the rest of the plate down with it.

4.9 Theory of Plate Tectonics

• Explain the theory of plate tectonics theory.
• Describe how plate tectonics leads to existence of supercontinents such as Pangaea.

What would Wegener think?
Like any great theory, plate tectonics makes a tremendous amount of sense. The whole story ﬁts together so perfectly.
Wegener had so much evidence that the continents had once been joined. Seaﬂoor spreading is a perfect mechanism
for moving those continents. It’s really too bad that Alfred Wegener is not here to learn about the theory of plate
tectonics. It seems certain that he would be ecstatic!

Plate Tectonics Theory

The theory of plate tectonics is what brings together continental drift and seaﬂoor spreading. Plates are made of
lithosphere topped with oceanic and/or continental crust. The plates are moved around on Earth’s surface by seaﬂoor
spreading. Convection in the mantle drives seaﬂoor spreading. Oceanic crust is created at mid-ocean ridges. The
crust moves outward from the ridge over time. The crust may eventually sink into the mantle and be destroyed. If a
continent sits on a plate with a mid-ocean ridge, the continent will be pushed along.

Plate Boundaries

Chapter 4. Plate Tectonics

Two plates meet at a plate boundary. There are three types of plate boundaries since there are three ways that plates
can meet. Plates can move away from each other. They can move toward each other. Finally, they can slide past
each other. The three types of plate boundaries are divergent, convergent, and transform. They are described in the
following three concepts.
Most geological activity takes place at plate boundaries. This activity includes volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain
building. The activity occurs as plates interact. Giant slabs of lithosphere moving around can create a lot of activity!
The features seen at a plate boundary are determined by the direction of plate motion and by the type of crust found
at the boundary.

What the Theory Explains

The theory of plate tectonics explains most of the features of Earth’s surface. It explains why earthquakes, volcanoes
and mountain ranges are where they are. It explains where to ﬁnd some mineral resources. Plate tectonics is the key
that unlocks many of the mysteries of our amazing planet. Plate tectonics theory explains why:

• Earth’s geography has changed over time and continues to change today.
• some places are prone to earthquakes while others are not.
• certain regions may have deadly, mild, or no volcanic eruptions.
• mountain ranges are located where they are.
• many ore deposits are located where they are.
• living and fossil species of plants and animals are found where they are.
• some continental margins have a lot of geological activity, and some have none.

Plate tectonic motions affect Earth’s rock cycle, climate, and the evolution of life.

Summary

• The theory of plate tectonics brings together continental drift and seaﬂoor spreading.
• At a plate boundary, two plates can be moving apart, together or past each other.
• Plate tectonics theory explains many things in geology, such as where volcanoes, earthquakes, mountain

ranges, ore deposits, and other features are located.

4.10 Divergent Plate Boundaries in the Oceans

• Summarize the activity and features of divergent plate boundaries in the ocean and on land.
• Describe mid-ocean ridges.

Why a photo of a bridge with some bleak looking rock?
In Iceland, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is above sea level. It’s the only place we can see a mid-ocean ridge out of the
water. The Midlina Bridge connects two plates. On the west side is the North American plate. On the east side is the
Eurasian plate. A mid-ocean ridge is where new crust is created. Eventually this spot will be beneath the Atlantic
Ocean.

Divergent Plate Boundaries

Plates move apart at a divergent plate boundary. This happens in the oceans at mid-ocean ridges. It happens on
land in continental rift zones.

Mid-ocean Ridges

In the oceans, plates move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Lava rises upward, erupts, and cools. Later, more lava erupts
and pushes the original seaﬂoor outward. This is seaﬂoor spreading. Seaﬂoor spreading forms new oceanic crust.
The rising magma causes the ridge to be buoyant. This is why there is a mountain range running through the oceans.
The plates pulling apart cause earthquakes.
Most mid-ocean ridges are located deep below the sea. The island of Iceland sits right on the Mid-Atlantic ridge (
Figure 4.14).

Continental Rifting

A divergent plate boundary can also occur within a continent. This is called continental rifting. Magma rises
beneath the continent. The crust thins, breaks, and then splits apart. This ﬁrst produces a rift valley. The East African
Rift is a rift valley. Eastern Africa is splitting away from the African continent. Eventually, as the continental crust
breaks apart, oceanic crust will form. This is how the Atlantic Ocean formed when Pangaea broke up.

4.11 Transform Plate Boundaries

• Describe transform plate boundaries and transform faults.

What does a transform plate boundary look like?
In the dry part of central California, it looks like this. On one side is the Paciﬁc Plate. On the other side is the North
American Plate. Before plate tectonics theory, people thought the San Andreas was just a fault. Now it’s known to
be a plate boundary!

Transform Plate Boundaries

Two plates may slide past each other in opposite directions. This is called a transform plate boundary. The plates
meet at a transform fault. As you might imagine, plates do not slide past each other easily. These plate boundaries

239

4.11. Transform Plate Boundaries

www.ck12.org

experience massive earthquakes. The world’s best known transform fault is the San Andreas Fault in California (
Figure 4.15). At this fault, the Paciﬁc and North American plates grind past each other. Transform plate boundaries
are common as offsets along mid-ocean ridges. They are very small compared to transform faults on land.
Transform plate boundaries are different from the other two types of plate boundaries. At divergent plate boundaries,
new oceanic crust is formed. At convergent boundaries, old oceanic crust is destroyed. But at transform plate
boundaries, crust is neither created nor destroyed.

FIGURE 4.15
The red line is the San Andreas Fault. On the left is the Paciﬁc Plate, which
is moving northeast. On the right is the North American Plate, which is
moving southwest. The movement of the plates is relative to each other.

• At transform plate boundaries, two plates move in opposite direction.
• Transform faults are the site of massive earthquakes.
• The San Andreas Fault is the boundary between the Paciﬁc and North American plates. It is the site of massive

earthquakes.

4.12 Ocean-Continent Convergent Plate Bound-

aries

• Explain a convergence plate boundary.
• Describe ocean-continent convergence and ocean-ocean convergence.

What do you see when oceanic lithosphere subducts?
At a convergent plate boundary, when one plate is oceanic, there are large volcanoes. These volcanoes are found
in lines that outline the subduction zone. Earthquakes also happen in these zones. The Aleutian Islands that border
southern Alaska are an island arc. In this winter image from space, the volcanoes are covered with snow.

Convergent Plate Boundaries

A convergent plate boundary forms where two plates collide. That collision can happen between a continent and
oceanic crust, between two oceanic plates, or between two continents. Oceanic crust is always destroyed in these
collisions.

241

4.12. Ocean-Continent Convergent Plate Boundaries

www.ck12.org

Ocean-Continent Convergence

Oceanic crust may collide with a continent. The oceanic plate is denser, so it undergoes subduction. This means
that the oceanic plate sinks beneath the continent. This occurs at an ocean trench ( Figure 4.16). Subduction zones
are where subduction takes place.

FIGURE 4.16
Subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a
continental plate forms a line of volcanoes
known as a continental arc and causes
earthquakes.

As you would expect, where plates collide there are lots of intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The
subducting oceanic plate melts as it reenters the mantle. The magma rises and erupts. This creates a volcanic
mountain range near the coast of the continent. This range is called a continental arc. The Andes Mountains, along
the western edge of South America, are a volcanic arc ( Figure 4.17).

Ocean-Ocean Convergence

Two oceanic plates may collide. In this case, the older plate is denser. This plate subducts beneath the younger plate.
As the subducting plate is pushed deeper into the mantle, it melts. The magma this creates rises and erupts. This
forms a line of volcanoes, known as an island arc ( Figure 4.18). Japan, Indonesia, the Philippine Islands, and the
Aleutian Islands of Alaska are examples of island arcs ( Figure 4.19).

Summary

• When two plates come toward each other, they create a convergent plate boundary.
• If at least one plate is oceanic, there will be subduction.
• Subduction of a plate leads to melting and volcanism.
• An island arc is a line of volcanoes on an oceanic plate. A continental arc is a line of volcanoes on a continental

plate.

4.13 Continent-Continent Convergent Plate

Boundaries

• Describe continent-continent convergent plate boundaries.
• Explain how mountains are formed.

What do you see at a continent-continent convergent plate boundary?
Big mountains! The best place to see two continental plates converging is in the Himalaya Mountains. These
mountains are the highest above sea level on Earth. They are very popular with mountain climbers.

Continent-Continent Convergence

Another type of convergent plate boundary is when two continental plates collide. Continental lithosphere is low
in density and very thick. Continental lithosphere cannot subduct. So when two continental plates collide, they just
smash together. This is just like what happens if you put your hands on two sides of a sheet of paper and bring your
hands together. The material has nowhere to go but up ( Figure 4.20)! Earthquakes and metamorphic rocks result
from the tremendous forces of the collision. But the crust is too thick for magma to get through. As a result, there
are no volcanoes at continent-continent collision zones.

Mountain Building

Continent-continent convergence creates some of the world’s largest mountains ranges. The Himalayas ( Figure
4.21) are the world’s tallest mountains. They are forming as two continents collide. The Appalachian Mountains
are the remnants of a larger mountain range. This range formed from continent-continent collisions in the time of
Pangaea.

impressive.

Summary

• Continental crust is too buoyant to subduct.
• When two continental plates converge, they smash together and create mountains.
• The amazing Himalaya Mountains are the result of this type of convergent plate boundary.
• The Appalachian Mountains resulted from ancient convergence when Pangaea came together.

4.14 Continental Margins

• Deﬁne continental margin.
• Compare active continental margins to passive continental margins.

Can plate tectonics explain the differences in these beaches?
Plate tectonics explains why some beaches have lots of cliffs and some do not. A beach with lots of cliffs is near a
plate boundary. A gentle beach is not. There are exceptions to this rule, but it works in some cases.

Continental Margins

Think of a continent, like North America. Surrounding the continent are continental margins. Continental crust
grades into oceanic crust at continental margins. Continental margins are under water. Almost all of North America
sits on the North American Plate ( Figure 4.22). Both sides of the continent have continental margins, but each is
very different. One continental margin of North America is an active margin. The other is a passive margin. Can
you guess which is which?

Active Margins

If a continental margin is near a plate boundary, it is an active margin. The continental margin of western North
America is near a set of plate boundaries. There are convergent boundaries, like where there is subduction off of the
Paciﬁc Northwest. There is a transform boundary, the San Andreas Fault. The small amount of the North American
continent that is not on the North American Plate is across the San Andreas Fault. It is on the Paciﬁc Plate. Western
North America has a lot of volcanoes and earthquakes. Mountains line the region. California, with its volcanoes and
earthquakes, is an important part of this active margin ( Figure 4.23).

Passive Margins

There are no volcanoes and very few earthquakes on the eastern edge of North America. The continental margin
is a smooth transition from continental to oceanic lithosphere. The continental margin there becomes oceanic
lithosphere, but both are on the North American Plate. There is no plate boundary. The far eastern edge of the
North American Plate is the mid-Atlantic Ridge. The portion of a plate that does not meet another plate has no
geological activity. It is called a passive margin ( Figure 4.24).

• Continental margins can be active or passive depending on whether they are near a plate boundary.
• Volcanoes and earthquakes are common at active margins. Active margins are near plate boundaries.
• Passive margins are passive. They have little or no geological activity.

4.15 Supercontinent Cycle

• Describe how Pangaea formed and then separated.
• Summarize the supercontinent cycle.

Is this Earth?
The existence of Wegener’s supercontinent Pangaea is completely accepted by geologists today. The movements of
continents explain so much about the geological activity we see. But did it all begin with Pangaea? Or were there
other supercontinents that came before? What does the future of the continents hold?

Pangaea

Wegener had lots of evidence for his continental drift hypothesis. One line of evidence was the similarity of the
mountains on the west and east sides of the Atlantic. Those mountains rose at convergent plate boundaries. The
continents on both sides of the ocean (where the Atlantic is now) smashed together to create Pangaea. The proto-
Atlantic ocean shrank as the Paciﬁc Ocean grew.
The Appalachian mountains of eastern North America formed at this convergent plate boundary ( Figure 4.25).
About 200 million years ago, they were probably as high as the Himalayas.

251

FIGURE 4.25
The Appalachian Mountains in New
Hampshire.

Pangaea has been breaking apart since about 250 million years ago. Divergent plate boundaries formed within the
continents to cause them to rift apart. The continents are still moving apart. The Paciﬁc is shrinking as the Atlantic
is growing. The Appalachians ( Figure 4.26) are now on a passive margin. The mighty mountains have weathered
and eroded to what they are today.

FIGURE 4.26
The Appalachians along the eastern U.S.
These mountains began when North
America and Eurasia collided as Pangaea
came together.

The Supercontinent Cycle

Back before Pangaea, there were earlier supercontinents. Rodinia existed 750 million to 1.1 billion years ago.
Columbia existed 1.5 to 1.8 billion years ago. If the continents continue in their current directions, they will come
together to create a supercontinent on the other side of the planet in around 200 million years.
This is known as the supercontinent cycle. The continents smash together on opposite side of the planet around
every 500 million years. The creation of supercontinents is responsible for most of the geologic features that we see.
It is responsible for many features that are long gone.

Summary

• Pangaea came together as a set of continent-continent convergent plate boundaries.
• Pangaea is still breaking up as the continents move apart. The Atlantic Ocean is getting bigger, and the Paciﬁc

Ocean is getting smaller.

• The continents come together and break apart about every 500 million years. This is called the supercontinent

cycle.

4.16. Intraplate Activity

www.ck12.org

4.16 Intraplate Activity

• Deﬁne hotspot.
• Describe and explain volcanic activity that occurs within oceanic and continental plates.

How come some geological activity takes place away from plate boundaries?
The geological activity in these photos is not at plate boundaries. Is plate tectonics wrong? Of course not! This
activity can also be explained. It’s the result of hotspots. Two hotspot locations are Hawaii and Yellowstone.

Intraplate Activity

Most geological activity takes place at plate boundaries. But some activity does not. Much of this intraplate activity
is found at hot spots. Hotspots are plumes of hot material that rise through the mantle. Hotspot volcanoes erupt
when the hot material melts to create magma.
Many hotspots appear to be ﬁxed in the mantle. This means that they do not move relative to each other. Plates move
above the hotspots, but the hotspots stay in the same spot. This feature is a very useful tool for scientists.

Hotspots in the Oceans

A chain of volcanoes form as an oceanic plate moves over a hotspot. This is how it happens. A volcano forms over
the hotspot. Since the plate is moving, the volcano moves off of the hotspot. When the hotspot erupts again, a new
volcano forms over it. This volcano is next to the ﬁrst. Over time, there is a line of volcanoes. The youngest is
directly above the hotspot. The oldest is the farthest away ( Figure 4.27).
The Hawaii-Emperor chain of volcanoes formed over the Hawaiian Hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands formed most
recently. Kilauea volcano is currently erupting. It is over the hotspot. The Emperor Seamounts are so old they no
longer reach above sea level. The oldest existing of the Emperor Seamounts is about to subduct into the Aleutian
trench off of Alaska. Older ones may already be in the trench. Geologists can get age dates from the volcanic rocks
that erupt at these hotspots. So they use hotspot chains to tell the direction and the speed a plate is moving.

Hotspots Beneath Continents

Hotspots are also found under the continental crust. Since it is more difﬁcult for magma to make it through the thick
crust, they are much less common. One exception is the Yellowstone hotspot ( Figure 4.28). This hotspot is very
active. In the past, the hotspot produced enormous volcanic eruptions. Now its activity is best seen in the region’s
famous geysers.

• Not all geological activity is found at plate boundaries. Activity within a plate is called intraplate activity.

Most intraplate activity occurs at hotspots.

• Hotspot volcanoes erupt mostly on oceanic crust. A few hotspots erupt on continental crust. The difference is

due to the thickness of the crust.

Summary

In the early 20th century, Alfred Wegener noticed that Africa and South America ﬁt together like puzzle pieces. He
was not the ﬁrst person to make this observation. But he was the ﬁrst to pursue it. Wegener gathered a tremendous
amount of evidence to suggest that the continents had once been joined. He proposed the hypothesis that continents
move around on Earth’s surface. He called his hypothesis continental drift. Unfortunately, Wegener could not come
up with a plausible mechanism that explained how solid continents could plow through ocean basins. At least not
one other scientists would accept. Wegener’s idea was brought back after World War II. Scientists started to put
together data about the seaﬂoor. It was not ﬂat, but had astonishing features! There was a the strange pattern of rock
ages across the seaﬂoor. Scientists also noticed a strange history of the magnetic north pole on land. In the early
1960s, Harold Hess propose seaﬂoor spreading as a mechanism for drifting continents. The theory of plate tectonics
is a combination of continental drift and seaﬂoor spreading. The theory explains what happens as plates of Earth’s
lithosphere move around on Earth’s surface.

What are the consequences of plate tectonics?
Giant plates of lithosphere moving around on a sphere has consequences. Big consequences. Most earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions are due to plate interactions. Mountains originate where plates interact. If Earth’s crust never
moved, there would be a lot fewer natural disasters!

5.1 Geological Stresses

• Deﬁne stress.
• Describe the types of geological stress.
• Describe the effects of stress on various types of rock under a range of conditions.

When people have too much stress they may break. What happens if a rock gets too much stress?
Lithospheric plates do a lot of moving on Earth’s surface. Slabs of lithosphere smash into each other. They move
sideways past each other along faults. Where conditions are right, magma rises through solid rock. It’s no wonder
that rocks experience stress! Rocks respond differently to different types of stress and under different conditions.

Types of Stress

Stress is the force applied to a rock. Plates experience stress when they collide, move apart, or slide past each
other. Plates moving on a rounded surface experience stress. Stress happens to rocks on a smaller scale, too. Local
movements can cause stress in rocks.
There are four types of stresses that affect rocks:

• Conﬁning stress comes from the weight of all the overlying rock. This weight pushes down on a deeply buried
rock. The rock is being pushed in from all sides, which compresses it. The rock will not deform because there
is no place for it to move.

261

5.1. Geological Stresses

www.ck12.org

• Compression stress squeezes rocks together. Compression causes rocks to fold or fracture ( Figure 5.1).
When two cars collide, compression causes them to crumple. Compression is the most common stress at
convergent plate boundaries.

FIGURE 5.1
Stress caused these rocks to fold.

• Tension stress pulls rocks apart. Tension causes rocks to lengthen or break apart. Tension is the major type of

stress found at divergent plate boundaries.

• Shear stress happens when forces slide past each other in opposite directions ( Figure 5.2). This is the most

common stress found at transform plate boundaries.

FIGURE 5.2
is pointing to a line.
This rock has undergone shearing. The pencil
Stresses forced rock on either side of that line to go in opposite directions.

Responses to Stress

The amount of stress on a rock may be greater than the rock’s strength. In that case, the rock will undergo strain or
deformation ( Figure 5.3). Deep within the Earth, the pressure is very great. A rock behaves like a stretched rubber
band. When the stress stops, the rock goes back to its original shape. If more stress is applied to the rock, it bends
and ﬂows. It does not return to its original shape. Near the surface, if the stress continues, the rock will fracture
(rupture) and break.

Summary

• Stress is the force applied to an object. Stresses can be conﬁning, compression, tension, or shear.
• Rocks under stress may show strain or deformation. Deformation can be elastic or plastic, or the rock may

fracture.

• Rocks respond to stress differently under different conditions.

5.2 Principle of Horizontality

• Identify rules for the formation and deformation of sedimentary rock.
• Explain how sedimentary rock helps scientists study geological history.

What is the pattern of the Grand Canyon rock layers?
If you go to the Grand Canyon, you’ll see layers of sedimentary rocks. These rocks are extremely well exposed for
viewing. Some people call this "layer cake geology." It looks like a layer cake, but not as tasty. Just like a cake, the
bottom layer is put down ﬁrst. Subsequent layers are deposited next. Where the layers are not horizontal, there was
deformation.

Sedimentary Rock Rules

Sedimentary rocks follow certain rules.

1. Sedimentary rocks form with the oldest layers on the bottom and the youngest on top.
2. Sediments are deposited horizontally so sedimentary rock layers are originally horizontal.
3. Sedimentary rock layers that are not horizontal are deformed.

Sedimentary rocks start out horizontal with the oldest on the bottom. Sedimentary rocks that are not horizontal
must be deformed. This deformation produces geologic structures such as folds, joints, and faults that are caused by
stresses. We can look at the deformation and structures out the deformation history of the rock.

Geologic Structures

Sedimentary rocks are formed in horizontal layers. This is magniﬁcently displayed around the southwestern United
States. The arid climate allows rock layers to be well exposed ( Figure 5.4). The lowest layers are the oldest, and
the higher layers are younger. This concept is called superposition since it deals with the positions of rock layers.

Layers of different types of rocks are ex-
posed in this photo from Grand Staircase-
Escalante National Monument. White lay-
ers of limestone are hard and form cliffs.
Red layers of shale are ﬂakier and form
slopes.

Folds, joints, and faults are caused by stresses. If a sedimentary rock is tilted or folded, we know that stresses have
changed the rock.

Summary

• Sedimentary rocks are laid down horizontally with the oldest at the bottom.
• Sedimentary rocks that are not horizontal have been deformed.
• Sedimentary rocks are very useful for determining the deformation history of an area.

5.3 Folds

• Deﬁne fold.
• Identify and deﬁne types of folds and related structures.

What folds can you see?
Moving around the desert Southwest, we see a lot of folds. This view is near the Valley of the Gods in Utah. Can
you see all of the types of folds mentioned below? All of the folds mentioned in the text below are found in the arid
Southwestern U.S.

Folds

Deep within the crust, as plates collide, rocks crumple into folds. You can model these folds by placing your hands
on opposite edges of a piece of cloth and pushing your hands together. Your hands moving toward each other creates
compressive stress. In sedimentary rocks, you can easily trace the folding of the layers ( Figure 5.5). In the image
below, the rock layers are no longer horizontal. They tilt downhill from right to left in a monocline. Once rocks are
folded, they do not return to their original shape.

Grand Staircase in Utah. Where the rocks
fold up, at the left of the diagram, is a
small syncline.

There are three types of folds: monoclines, anticlines, and synclines.

Monocline

A monocline is a simple “one step“ bend in the rock layers ( Figure 5.6). In a monocline, the oldest rocks are at the
bottom, and the youngest are at the top.

FIGURE 5.6
The rock layers in the center left are tilted
in one direction, forming a monocline.

Anticline

An anticline is a fold that arches upward. The rocks dip away from the center of the fold ( Figure 5.7). The oldest
rocks are found at the center of an anticline. The youngest rocks are draped over them at the top of the structure.
When upward folding rocks form a circular structure, that structure is called a dome. If the top of the dome is eroded
off, the oldest rocks are exposed at the center.

FIGURE 5.7
(A) An anticline is a convex upward fold.
(B) This anticline is at Calico Ghost Town,
California.

Syncline

A syncline is a fold that bends downward ( Figure 5.8). In a syncline, the youngest rocks are at the center. The
oldest rocks are at the outside edges. When rocks bend downward in a circular structure, it is called a basin. If the
rocks are eroded, the youngest rocks are at the center. Basins can be enormous, like the Michigan Basin.

Summary

• Rocks deform by compressive stress into folds.
• A monocline is a simple bend in one-direction.
• In an anticline, rocks arch upward. A three-dimensional anticline is a dome.
• In a syncline, rocks arch downward. A three-dimensional syncline is a basin.

5.4 Faults

• Describe joints and faults.
• Identify types of faults.

Why is this lake so long and straight?
The photo is of Crystal Springs Reservoir near the San Francisco Bay Area. The water has collected in a low point
in the land. The reason for the low point is a fault, the San Andreas Fault. On one side of the reservoir is the Paciﬁc
Plate. On the other side is the North American Plate. Would this be a good place to build a home?

Fractures

A rock under enough stress will fracture. There may or may not be movement along the fracture. If there is not
movement, the fracture is a joint. If there is movement, the fracture is a fault.

Joints

If there is no movement on either side of a fracture, the fracture is called a joint. Basalt rocks in Asia show horizontal
and vertical joints ( Figure 5.9). These joints formed as the lava cooled and contracted.

Faults

If the rocks on one or both sides of a fracture move, the fracture is called a fault ( Figure 5.10). Faults can occur
alone or in clusters. A cluster of faults creates a fault zone. Earthquakes happen when rocks break and move

suddenly. The energy released causes an earthquake.

FIGURE 5.10
A series of faults offset this outcrop along Highway 191 in Moab, Utah.

Dip-Slip Fault

Slip is the distance rocks move along a fault, as one block of rock moves past the other. The angle of a fault is called
the fault’s dip. If the fault dips at an angle, the fault is a dip-slip fault ( Figure 5.11).
Imagine you are standing on a road looking at the fault. The hanging wall is the rock that overlies the fault. The
footwall is beneath the fault. If you are walking along a fault, the hanging wall is above you. The footwall is where
your feet would be. Miners often extract mineral resources along faults. They used to hang their lanterns above their
heads. That is why these layers were called the hanging wall.

Normal Faults

In normal faults, the hanging wall drops down relative to the footwall. Normal faults are caused by tension that
pulls the crust apart. This causes the hanging wall to slide down. Normal faults can build huge mountain ranges in
regions experiencing tension ( Figure 5.12).
An animation of a normal fault is seen here: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/animations/animation.php?ﬂash_titl

right diagram shows a normal fault.

FIGURE 5.12
The Sierra Nevada Mountains in eastern
California rose up along a normal fault.

Thrust Faults

When compression squeezes the crust into a smaller space, the hanging wall pushes up relative to the footwall. This
creates a reverse fault. A thrust fault is a type of reverse fault. With a thrust fault the angle of the fault is close to
horizontal. Rocks can slip many miles along thrust faults ( Figure 5.13).
An animation of a thrust fault is seen here: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/animations/animation.php?ﬂash_titl

FIGURE 5.13
In this thrust fault, the rock on the right
is thrust over the rock on the left. The
rock on the right has also started to fold
because of this movement.

Strike-Slip Faults

A strike-slip fault is a dip-slip fault where the dip of the fault plane is vertical. Strike-slip faults result from shear
stresses. If you stand with one foot on each side of a strike-slip fault, one side will be moving toward you while the
other side moves away from you. If your right foot moves toward you, the fault is known as a right-lateral strike-slip
fault. If your left foot moves toward you, the fault is a left-lateral strike-slip fault ( Figure 5.14).

San Andreas Fault

The San Andreas Fault in California is a right-lateral strike slip fault ( Figure 5.15). It is also a transform fault
because the San Andreas is a plate boundary. Unlike what some people think, California will not fall into the ocean
someday. The land west of the San Andreas Fault is moving northeastward, while the North American plate moves
southwest. Someday, millions of years from now, Los Angeles will be a suburb of San Francisco!

People sometimes say that California will fall into the ocean someday. This is not true! Someday Los Angeles will
be a suburb of San Francisco (or will it be the other way around?).

Summary

• A fracture with no movement on either side is a joint.
• Dip-slip faults show vertical movement. In a normal fault, the hanging wall drops down relative to the footwall.

The reverse is true of a reverse fault.

5.5 Mountain Building

• Explain how converging or diverging plates can create mountain ranges.

How do plate motions create mountains?
Plate tectonic processes create some of the world’s most beautiful places. The North Cascades Mountains in
Washington State are a continental volcanic arc. The mountains currently host some glaciers. There are many
features left by the more abundant ice age glaciers. Changes in altitude make the range a habitable place for many
living organisms.

Stress and Mountain Building

Many processes create mountains. Most mountains form along plate boundaries. A few mountains may form in the
middle of a plate. For example, hotspot volcanoes.

Continent-Continent Convergence

Most of the world’s largest mountains form as plates collide at convergent plate boundaries. Continental crust is too
buoyant to get pushed down into the mantle. So when the plates smash together, the crust crumples upward. This
creates mountains. Folding and faulting in these collision zones makes the crust thicker.
The world’s highest mountain range, the Himalayas, is growing as India collides with Eurasia. About 80 million
years ago, India was separated from Eurasia by an ocean ( Figure 5.16). As the plates collided, pieces of the old
seaﬂoor were forced over the Asian continent. This old seaﬂoor is now found high in the Himalayas ( Figure 5.17).

Oceanic Plate Subduction

Volcanic mountain ranges form when oceanic crust subducts into the mantle at convergent plate boundaries. The
Andes Mountains are a chain of coastal volcanic mountains. They are forming as the Nazca plate subducts beneath
the South American plate ( Figure 5.18).

Chapter 5. Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes

Continents can also rift apart; a process called continental rifting. When continental crust is pulled apart, it breaks
into blocks. These blocks of crust are separated by normal faults. This is known as block faulting. The blocks slide
up or down. The result is alternating mountain ranges and valleys. This topography is known as basin-and-range
( Figure 5.19). The area near Death Valley, California is the center of a classic basin-and-range province ( Figure
5.20).

This diagram shows how a basin-and-
range forms.

Summary

• Converging or diverging plates cause mountains to grow.
• Subduction of oceanic crust beneath a continental or oceanic plate creates a chain of volcanoes.
• Tensional forces bring about block faulting. This creates a basin-and-range valleys and mountains.

5.6 Earthquake Characteristics

• Deﬁne earthquakes.
• Explain why earthquakes occur.

What causes the greatest damage in an earthquake?
This photo shows the Mission District of San Francisco burning after the 1906 earthquake. The greatest damage in
earthquakes is usually not from the ground shaking. The greatest damage is caused by the effects of that shaking. In
this earthquake, the shaking broke the gas mains and the water pipes. When the gas caught ﬁre, there was no way to
put it out. Fire causes the greatest damage in many earthquakes.

Earthquake!

An earthquake is sudden ground movement. This movement is caused by the sudden release of the energy stored
in rocks. An earthquake happens when so much stress builds up in the rocks that the rocks break. An earthquake’s
energy is transmitted by seismic waves.

Causes of Earthquakes

Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within
the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks
break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake.
During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters.
Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure 5.21).

FIGURE 5.21
Elastic rebound theory. Stresses build on both sides of a fault. The
rocks deform plastically as seen in Time 2. When the stresses become
too great, the rocks return to their original shape. To do this, the rocks
move, as seen in Time 3. This movement releases energy, creating an
earthquake.

Focus and Epicenter

The two important words used to describe an earthquake’s location are focus and epicenter.

Focus

The point where the rock ruptures is the earthquake’s focus. The focus is below the Earth’s surface. A shallow
earthquake has a focus less than 70 kilometers (45 miles). An intermediate-focus earthquake has a focus between 70
and 300 kilometers (45 to 200 miles). A deep-focus earthquake is greater than 300 kilometers (200 miles). About
75% of earthquakes have a focus in the top 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) of the crust. Shallow earthquakes cause
the most damage. This is because the focus is near the Earth’s surface, where people live.

Epicenter

The area just above the focus, on the land surface, is the earthquake’s epicenter ( Figure 5.22). The towns or cities
near the epicenter will be strongly affected by the earthquake.

Summary

• A sudden release of energy stored in rocks causes an earthquake.
• The focus is where the rocks rupture. The epicenter is the point on the ground directly above the focus.
• Most earthquakes are shallow. Shallow earthquakes do the most damage.

• Summarize the location of most of the world’s earthquakes.

What caused the earthquake in Angol, Chile in 2010?
Angol, Chile experienced a huge 8.8 magnitude earthquake in February 2010. The earthquake was due to subduction
of the Nazca plate beneath South America. This subduction zone is part of the Paciﬁc Ring of Fire.

Annual Earthquakes

In a single year, on average, more than 900,000 earthquakes are recorded. About 150,000 of them are strong enough
to be felt. Each year about 18 earthquakes are major, with a Richter magnitude of 7.0 to 7.9, and on average one
earthquake has a magnitude of 8 to 8.9.
Magnitude 9 earthquakes are rare. The United States Geological Survey lists ﬁve since 1900 ( Figure 5.23 and Table
5.1). All but the Great Indian Ocean Earthquake of 2004 occurred somewhere around the Paciﬁc Ocean basin.

Earthquake Zones

Nearly 95% of all earthquakes take place along one of the three types of plate boundaries.

• About 80% of all earthquakes strike around the Paciﬁc Ocean basin because it is lined with convergent and
transform boundaries ( Figure 5.24). The region around the Paciﬁc is called the Paciﬁc Ring of Fire due to
its earthquakes and volcanoes.

• About 15% take place in the Mediterranean-Asiatic Belt. Convergence is causing the Indian Plate to run into

the Eurasian Plate.

• The remaining 5% are scattered around other plate boundaries. A few earthquakes take place away from plate

boundaries. These are intraplate earthquakes.

Summary

• Small earthquakes are extremely common, but the largest earthquakes are extremely rare.
• The vast majority of earthquakes happen at plate boundaries.
• The Paciﬁc Ocean basin has the most earthquakes due to convergent and transform plate boundaries. The

Himalaya region has the second most due to the convergence of India and Asia.

What does the future of San Francisco hold?
The last large earthquake along the San Andreas Fault in the San Francisco area stuck in 1906. The city was
devastated. Studies show that big quakes occur every 125 years or more. Small quakes seem to precede large ones,
and there have been some small ones in recent years. What do you think the future holds for San Francisco?

Transform Plate Boundaries

Transform plate boundaries produce enormous and deadly earthquakes. These quakes at transform faults are shallow
focus. This is because the plates slide past each other without moving up or down.
The San Andreas Fault that runs through much of California is an enormous transform plate boundary. It is the
plate boundary between Paciﬁc and North American plates. The largest earthquake in recorded history on the San
Andreas Fault occurred in 1906. The quake’s epicenter was just north of in San Francisco. About 3,000 people died
and 28,000 buildings were lost, mostly in the ﬁre that followed the earthquake.
There are many other faults spreading off the San Andreas, to take up the plate motion. In total the San Andreas
Fault system produces around 10,000 earthquakes a year ( Figure 5.25). While most of those earthquakes cannot

New Zealand also has a transform fault with strike-slip motion, causing about 20,000 earthquakes a year! Only a
small percentage of those are large enough to be felt. A 6.3 quake in Christchurch in February 2011 killed about 180
people.

• Describe earthquakes that take place at convergent plate boundaries.

What damage is done to people’s lives by earthquakes?
In a large earthquake hundreds or thousands of people may die. Many more may lose their homes and livelihoods.
After a large quake, the world’s attention turns to help the victims. But soon there is another disaster in the news,
and the world’s attention turns. People may be left homeless due to an earthquake for many years.

Convergent Plate Boundaries

Earthquakes at convergent plate boundaries mark the location of the subducting lithosphere. The motion of the
lithosphere as it plunges through the mantle causes the quakes ( Figure 5.27). At greater depths, the plate heats up
enough to deform plastically.
Convergent plate boundaries produce earthquakes most of the way around the Paciﬁc Ocean basin.

Earthquakes in Japan are caused by ocean-ocean convergence.
subducts beneath oceanic crust. This creates as many as 1,500 earthquakes every year.
In March 2011, the 9.0 magnitude T¯ohoku earthquake struck off of northeastern Japan. Damage from the quake was
severe. Even more severe was the damage from the tsunami generated by the quake ( Figure 5.28 and Figure 5.29).
A tsunami is an enormous ocean wave or set of waves generated by an underwater earthquake. In all, 25,000 people
were known dead or missing.

Ocean-Continent: Cascades

The Paciﬁc Northwest of the United States is at risk from a potentially massive earthquake. The subduction of
three small plates beneath North America produces active volcanoes, the Cascades. The region also experiences
earthquakes. However, large earthquakes only hit every 300 to 600 years. The last was in 1700. That quake had
an estimated magnitude of around 9. A quake of that magnitude today could produce an incredible amount of
destruction and untold fatalities.
An image of earthquake epicenters beneath the Paciﬁc Northwest and the depth to the epicenter is shown here: http

Continent-Continent: Asia

The collision of two continents also creates massive earthquakes. Many earthquakes happen in the region in and
around the Himalayan Mountains. The 2001 Gujarat, India earthquake is responsible for about 20,000 deaths, with
many more people injured or made homeless ( Figure 5.30).

Summary

• Earthquakes occur all along the subducting plate as it plunges into the mantle.
• All three types of convergent plate boundaries produce massive earthquakes.
• Subduction zones around the Paciﬁc Rim are responsible for many of the world’s earthquakes.

5.10 Intraplate Earthquakes

• Identify the causes of intraplate earthquakes.

When can you go up in the Washington Monument again?
An earthquake in August 2011 in Virginia cracked the top of the Washington Monument. After 32 months of repair,
the monument reopened to the public. Other sites in Washington, D.C., like the National Cathedral, were also
damaged.

Intraplate Earthquakes

About 5% of earthquakes take place within a plate, away from plate boundaries. These intraplate earthquakes
are caused by stresses within a plate. Since plates move over a spherical surface, zones of weakness are created.
Intraplate earthquakes happen along these zones of weakness. The earthquakes may take place along ancient faults
or rift zones.

2011 Virginia Earthquake

www.ck12.org

In August 2011, the eastern seaboard of the U.S. was rocked by a magnitude 5.8 earthquake. While not huge, most
of the residents had never experienced an earthquake. Many didn’t know what had happened!
This region is no longer part of an active plate boundary. But a few hundred million years ago, at the end of the
Paleozoic, things were different. Continent-continent convergence was bringing Pangaea together. This region was
being uplifted into the ancestral Appalachian mountains. There are still ancient faults that sometimes reactivate.

New Madrid Earthquake

In 1812, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck near New Madrid, Missouri. The earthquake was strongly felt over
approximately 50,000 square miles. The quake even altered the course of the Mississippi River. Because very few
people lived in the area at the time, only 20 people died. Many more people live there today ( Figure 5.31). A
similar earthquake today would undoubtedly kill many people and cause a great deal of property damage. The New
Madrid Seismic Zone continues to be active.

FIGURE 5.31
The New Madrid seismic zone is located in the interior of the North American plate (near Missouri, Arkansas,
Tennessee, Kentucky, and Illinois).

5.11 Seismic Waves from Earthquakes

• Describe the different types of seismic waves.
• Explain how scientists attempt to predict earthquakes.

Are seismic waves like ocean waves?
Yes, in some ways. Ocean waves travel at the interface between the sea surface and the atmosphere. They have all
the features that all waves have. Some seismic waves also travel at an interface. Which ones?

Seismic Waves

Seismic waves are the energy from earthquakes. Seismic waves move outward in all directions away from their
source. Each type of seismic wave travels at different speeds in different materials. All seismic waves travel through
rock, but not all travel through liquid or gas. Geologists study seismic waves to learn about earthquakes and the
Earth’s interior.

Wave Structure

Seismic waves are just one type of wave. Sound and light also travel in waves. Every wave has a high point called
a crest and a low point called a trough. The height of a wave from the center line to its crest is its amplitude. The
horizontal distance between waves from crest to crest (or trough to trough) is its wavelength ( Figure 5.32).

296

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes

FIGURE 5.32
The energy from earthquakes travels in
waves, such as the one shown in this
diagram.

Types of Seismic Waves

There are two major types of seismic waves. Body waves travel through the Earth’s interior. Surface waves travel
along the ground surface.
In an earthquake, body waves are responsible for the sharp jolts. Surface waves are
responsible for the rolling motions that do most of the damage in an earthquake.

Body Waves

Primary waves (P-waves) and secondary waves (S-waves) are the two types of body waves ( Figure 5.33). Body
waves move at different speeds through different materials.
P-waves are faster. They travel at about 6 to 7 kilometers (about 4 miles) per second. Primary waves are so named
because they are the ﬁrst waves to reach a seismometer. P-waves squeeze and release rocks as they travel. The
material returns to its original size and shape after the P-wave goes by. For this reason, P-waves are not the most
damaging earthquake waves. P-waves travel through solids, liquids, and gases.
S-waves are slower than P-waves. They are the second waves to reach a seismometer. S-waves move up and down.
They change the rock’s shape as they travel. S-waves are about half as fast as P-waves, at about 3.5 km (2 miles) per
second. S-waves can only move through solids. This is because liquids and gases don’t resist changing shape.

FIGURE 5.33
P-waves and S-waves are the two types
of body waves.

297

5.11. Seismic Waves from Earthquakes

www.ck12.org

Surface Waves

FIGURE 5.34
Love waves and Rayleigh waves are the
two types of surface waves.

Surface waves travel along the ground outward from an earthquake’s epicenter. Surface waves are the slowest of all
seismic waves. They travel at 2.5 km (1.5 miles) per second. There are two types of surface waves. Love waves
move side-to-side, much like a snake. Rayleigh waves produce a rolling motion as they move up and backward (
Figure 5.34). Surface waves cause objects to fall and rise. They also cause objects to sway back and forth. These
motions cause damage to rigid structures during an earthquake.

Summary

• Body waves travel through the body of a planet. Surface waves travel along the surface.
• There are two types of body waves: P-waves travel fastest and through solids, liquids, and gases; S-waves

only travel through solids.

• Surface waves are the slowest, but they do the most damage in an earthquake.

5.12 Predicting Earthquakes

• Explain how scientists attempt to predict earthquakes.
• Describe the signs of an upcoming earthquake.

What if you could predict an earthquake?
What would make a good prediction? Knowing where, when, and the magnitude of the quake would make it possible
for people to evacuate. If you were right, you would be famous! But if you were wrong, many people would be
angry with you.

Earthquake Prediction

Scientists are a long way from being able to predict earthquakes. A good prediction must be detailed and accurate.
Where will the earthquake occur? When will it occur? What will be its approximate magnitude? With a good

300

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes

prediction, authorities could get people to evacuate. But if the prediction were wrong, a lot of money would be lost
as people closed businesses and skipped work. Plus people would be unlikely to believe the authorities the next time.

Predicting Where

Where an earthquake will occur is the easiest feature to predict. How would you predict this? Scientists know that
earthquakes take place at plate boundaries. They tend to happen where they’ve happened before ( Figure 5.35).

FIGURE 5.35
This map shows earthquake probability
regions in the United States.

Fault segments behave consistently. A segment with frequent small earthquakes will likely continue to have frequent
small earthquakes. A fault segment with infrequent huge earthquakes will likely have infrequent huge earthquakes.
The image below shows the probabilities of earthquakes striking along various faults in the San Francisco area (
Figure 5.36). The time frame is between 2003 (when the work was done) and 2032.

Predicting When

When an earthquake will occur is much more difﬁcult to predict. Stress on a fault builds up at the same rate over
time. So earthquakes should occur at regular intervals. But, so far, scientists cannot predict when quakes will occur
even to within a few years. Around Parkﬁeld, California, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or higher occurs about
every 22 years. So seismologists predicted that one would strike in 1993. But that quake came in 2004—11 years
late ( Figure 5.37).

Earthquake Signs

There are sometimes signs that a large earthquake is coming. There may be small quakes, called foreshocks. These
can occur a few seconds to a few weeks before a major quake. Unfortunately, foreshocks are not very useful for
predicting large earthquakes. Many quakes do not have foreshocks. Also, small earthquakes are not necessarily
followed by a large earthquake.
There are other possible signs before an earthquake. The ground may tilt. Ground tilting is caused by the buildup
of stress in the rocks. This may happen before a large earthquake, but it doesn’t always. Water levels in wells may
ﬂuctuate. This is because water may move into or out of fractures before an earthquake. This is also an uncertain
way to predict an earthquake. The difference in arrival times of P-waves and S-waves may decrease just before an
earthquake occurs.

Chapter 5. Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes

Folklore tells of animals behaving strangely just before an earthquake. Most people tell stories of these behaviors
after the earthquake. Chinese scientists have actively studied the behavior of animals before earthquakes to see if
there is a connection. So far nothing concrete has come of these studies.
Actions can reduce the damage once an earthquake has started. Seismometers can detect P-waves a few seconds
before more damaging S-waves and surface waves arrive. In this time computers can shut down gas mains and
electrical transmission lines. They can initiate protective measures in chemical plants, nuclear power plants, mass
transit systems, airports, and roadways. Just a few seconds can be tremendously valuable.

Summary

• A good prediction must indicate when and where an earthquake will take place.
• Fault segments behave the same way over time.
• Signs that an earthquakes may occur include foreshocks, ground tilting, water levels in wells, and the relative

arrival times of P- and S-waves.

5.13 21st Century Tsunami

• Describe tsunami.

Why should you pay attention in school?
Eleven-year-old Tilly Smith and her family were walking along the beach in Phuket, Thailand on December 26,
2004. Tilly noticed that the sea was bubbling. She thought this was like a video she’d seen in geography class two
weeks earlier. The English schoolgirl insisted to her parents that a tsunami was coming. Her warning saved the
approximately 100 tourists and civilians who were on that beach.

Tsunami

Earthquakes can cause tsunamis. These deadly ocean waves may result from any shock to ocean water. A shock
could be a meteorite impact, landslide, or a nuclear explosion. But most come from large underwater earthquakes.
An underwater earthquake creates a tsunami this way: the movement of the crust displaces water. The displacement
forms a set of waves. The waves travel at jet speed through the ocean. Since the waves have low amplitudes and
long wavelengths, they are unnoticed in deep water. As the waves reach shore they compress. They are also pushed
upward by the shore. For these reasons, tsunamis can grow to enormous wave heights. Tsunami waves can cause
tremendous destruction and loss of life. Fortunately, few undersea earthquakes generate tsunamis.

The Boxing Day Tsunami, 2004

The Boxing Day Tsunami struck on December 26, 2004. The tsunami was caused by one of the largest earthquakes
ever recorded. The Indian Ocean Earthquake registered magnitude 9.1. The quake struck near Sumatra, Indonesia,
where the Indian plate is subducting beneath the Burma plate. It released about 550 million times the energy of the
atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

304

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes

Several tsunami waves were created. The waves went around the Indian Ocean and struck eight countries ( Figure
5.38).

FIGURE 5.38
Travel time map for the Boxing Day Tsunami (in hours). Countries near
red, orange, and yellow areas were affected the most.

About 230,000 people died. More than 1.2 million people lost their homes. Many more lost their way of making a
living. Fishermen lost their boats, and businesspeople lost their restaurants and shops. Many marine animals washed
onshore, including dolphins, turtles, and sharks.

Japan Tsunami, 2011

The Japanese received a one-two punch in March 2011. The 2011 T¯ohoku earthquake offshore was a magnitude 9.0,
and damage from the quake was extensive. The earthquake generated massive tsunami waves which hit the island
nation. Waves in some regions topped 9 meters (27 feet).
The tsunami did much more damage than the massive earthquake. In the photo of Sendai ( Figure 5.39), the black
smoke is coming from an oil reﬁnery. The reﬁnery was set on ﬁre due to the earthquake. The tsunami prevented
efforts to extinguish the ﬁre for several days.

FIGURE 5.39
An aerial view shows the damage to Sendai, Japan caused by the
earthquake and tsunami.

Worst of all was the damage done to nuclear power plants along the northeastern coast. Eleven reactors were
automatically shut down. Power and backup power were lost at the Fukushima plant. This lead to equipment
failures, meltdowns, and the release of radioactive materials. Cleanup of the disabled plants will go on for many
years.

Tsunami Warning Systems

Most of the Indian Ocean tragedy could have been avoided if a warning system had been in place ( Figure 5.40).
As of June 2006, the Indian Ocean now has a warning system. Communities around the Paciﬁc have had a tsunami
warning system since 1948.
As in Japan, warning systems aren’t always helpful. People in communities very close to the earthquake do not have
enough time to move out of the area. Farther away from the quake, evacuation of low-lying areas saves lives.

shore.

• Tsunami warning systems are now found in most locations where tsunamis are possible.
• The Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004 came from a massive earthquake. The waves traveled across the Indian

Ocean, causing death and destruction in 12 nations.

• In Japan, the tsunami struck very quickly after the 9.0 earthquake in the subduction zone offshore. Many more

people died from the tsunami than the quake.

5.14 Measuring Earthquake Magnitude

• Describe instruments scientists use to measure earthquakes.
• Explain the information seismograms provide.

Have you ever felt an earthquake?
Small earthquakes are fairly common in some parts of the world. Depending on the quake, the land, and the setting,
people experience them differently. You may wonder why your chair is moving, when you are sitting still. You may
think someone is running across the roof. In a skyscraper, you may be swaying. Seismometers quantify this and
record the energy released in the quake.

Measuring Seismic Waves

Seismic waves are measured on a seismograph. Seismographs contain a lot of information, and not just about
earthquakes.

307

5.14. Measuring Earthquake Magnitude

www.ck12.org

Seismometers

A seismograph is a machine that records seismic waves. In the past, seismographs produced a seismogram. A
seismogram is a paper record of the seismic waves the seismograph received. Seismographs have a weighted
pen suspended from a stationary frame. A drum of paper is attached to the ground. As the ground shakes in an
earthquake, the pen remains stationary but the drum moves beneath it. This creates the squiggly lines that make up
a seismogram ( Figure 5.41).

FIGURE 5.41
This seismograph records seismic waves.

Modern seismometers record ground motions using electronic motion detectors. The data are then kept digitally on
a computer.

What We Learn from Seismograms

Seismograms contain a lot of information about an earthquake: its strength, length, and distance. Wave height is
used to determine the magnitude of the earthquake. The seismogram shows the different arrival times of the seismic
waves ( Figure 5.42). The ﬁrst waves are P-waves since they are the fastest. S-waves come in next and are usually
larger than P-waves. The surface waves arrive just after the S-waves. If the earthquake has a shallow focus, the
surface waves are the largest ones recorded.

FIGURE 5.42
These seismograms show the arrival of P-
waves and S-waves.

A seismogram may record P-waves and surface waves, but not S-waves. This means that it was located more than
halfway around the Earth from the earthquake. What does that mean? Earth’s outer core is liquid. S-waves cannot

308

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes

travel through liquid. So the liquid outer core creates an S-wave shadow zone on the opposite side of the Earth from
the quake.
Like most things, seismographs are now digital. Information from seismic waves is fed into computers at seismic
stations around the world.
This animation shows three different stations picking up seismic waves: http://www.iris.edu/hq/files/programs/ed
ucation_and_outreach/aotm/10/4StationSeismoNetwork480.mov .

Summary

• A seismograph records seismic waves on a seismogram. A seismometer is a digital seismic wave recorder.
• S-waves do not travel through liquids. So a seismogram with no S-waves is on the other side of the planet

from the quake.

• Seismographs yield a tremendous amount of information about an earthquake.

5.15 Locating Earthquake Epicenters

• Explain how to ﬁnd an earthquake epicenter.

Can you ﬁnd an earthquake epicenter?
The epicenter of the 2011 Japan earthquake was just offshore of Sendai. This is where the Paciﬁc Plate plunges
into a subduction zone. The earthquake had a relatively shallow depth of 20 miles (32 km). Remember that shallow
quakes typically cause the most damage. How do scientists ﬁnd an earthquake epicenter?

Finding the Epicenter

One seismogram indicates the distance to the epicenter. This is determined by the P-and S-wave arrival times. If a
quake is near the seismograph, the S-waves arrive shortly after the P-waves. If a quake is far from the seismograph,
the P-waves arrive long before the S-waves. The longer the time is between the P-and S-wave arrivals, the further
away the earthquake was from the seismograph. First, seismologists calculate the arrival time difference. Then they
know the distance to the epicenter from that seismograph. They can connect all the points that are that distance from
the seismic station. This makes a circle around the station!
Next, the seismologists try to determine the location of the earthquake epicenter. To do this they need the distances
to the epicenter from at least three seismographs. Let’s say that they know that an earthquake’s epicenter is 50
kilometers from Kansas City. They draw a circle with a 50 km radius around that seismic station. They do this twice
more around two different seismic stations. The three circles intersect at a single point. This is the earthquake’s
epicenter ( Figure 5.43).
Of course, it’s been a long time since scientists drew circles to locate an earthquake epicenter. This is all done
digitally now. but it’s a great way to learn the basics of locating an epicenter.

How do scientists measure earthquakes?
This 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile in 2010 caused over 500 deaths and thousands of injuries. Earthquakes and
the damage they cause can be measured in a few different ways. One way is to describe the damage. The other way
is to measure the energy of the quake.

Earthquake Intensity

The ways seismologists measure an earthquake have changed over the decades. Initially, they could only measure
what people felt and saw: the intensity. For this, they used the Mercalli scale.

Mercalli Scale

Early in the 20th century, earthquakes were described in terms of what people felt and the damage that was done to
buildings. The Mercalli intensity scale describes earthquake intensity.
There are many problems with the Mercalli scale. The damage from an earthquake is affected by many things. The
type of ground a building sits on is very important to what happens to that building in a quake. Different people
experience an earthquake differently. Using this scale, comparisons between earthquakes were difﬁcult to make. A
new scale was needed.

Chapter 5. Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes

Earthquake Magnitude

For decades scientists have had equipment that can measure earthquake magnitude. The earthquake magnitude is
the energy released during the quake.

The Richter Magnitude Scale

Charles Richter developed the Richter magnitude scale in 1935. The Richter scale measures the magnitude of an
earthquake’s largest jolt of energy. This is determined by using the height of the waves recorded on a seismograph.
The Richter scale is logarithmic. The magnitudes jump from one level to the next. The height of the largest wave
increases 10 times with each level. So the height of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 quake is 10 times that
of a magnitude 4 quake. A magnitude 5 is 100 times that of a magnitude 3 quake. With each level, thirty times more
energy is released. A difference of two levels on the Richter scale equals 900 times more released energy.
The Richter scale has limitations. A single sharp jolt measures higher on the Richter scale than a very long intense
earthquake. Yet, this is misleading because the longer quake releases more energy. Earthquakes that release more
energy are likely to do more damage. As a result, another scale was needed.

The Moment Magnitude Scale

The moment magnitude scale is the favored method of measuring earthquake magnitudes. It measures the total
energy released by an earthquake. Moment magnitude is calculated by two things. One is the length of the fault
break. The other is the distance the ground moves along the fault. Japan’s T¯ohoku earthquake in 2011 had a
magnitude of 9.0 ( Figure 5.44).

FIGURE 5.44
Earthquake and tsunami damage in Japan, 2011. The T¯ohoku earthquake
had a magnitude of 9.0.

Summary

• Mercalli Intensity Scale depends on many factors other than the amount of energy released in the earthquake.
These factors include the type of rock in the region. They also include the quality of the structures built in the
area.

• The Richter scale is a logarithmic scale that measures the largest jolt of energy released by an earthquake.
• The moment magnitude scale is a logarithmic scale that measures the total amount of energy released by an

earthquake.

5.17 Earthquake Damage

• Identify factors that make an earthquake damaging and deadly.

Is earthquake magnitude the most important factor in determining damage?
The type of construction has a tremendous effect on what happens during an earthquake. Damage and deaths
are directly affected by the construction in an earthquake. For example, enormous damage was done in the 2011
Christchurch, New Zealand earthquake. However, far less was damaged in an earthquake of the same magnitude
near the area in Iceland seen above.

Damage from Earthquakes

We know that earthquakes kill lots of people. However, the ground shaking almost never kills people. Unlike in
cartoons, the ground does not swallow someone up! Deaths depend somewhat on an earthquake’s size and the type of
ground people inhabit. But a very important factor is the quality of the structures. People are killed when structures
fall on them. More damage is done and more people are killed by the ﬁres that follow an earthquake. Of course, the
number of deaths is different from the property damage that a quake does.

What Makes an Earthquake Deadly?

What makes an earthquake deadly?

• Population density. The magnitude 9.2 Great Alaska Earthquake, near Anchorage, of 1964 resulted in only

131 deaths. At the time few people lived in the area ( Figure 5.45).

FIGURE 5.45

Alaska earthquake.

5.17. Earthquake Damage

www.ck12.org

• Size, but not size. No one dies in a magnitude 1.0 earthquake. But large quakes to not always kill a lot of
people. Only about 2,000 people died in the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake. This was the largest earthquake
ever recorded. The Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004 was one of the largest ever. Still, most of the 230,000
fatalities were caused by the tsunami, not the earthquake.

• Ground type. Solid bedrock vibrates less than soft sediments, so there is less damage on bedrock. Sometimes
sediments become saturated with water. They then undergo liquefaction and become like quicksand ( Figure
5.46). Soil on a hillside may become a landslide.

FIGURE 5.46
Liquefaction of sediments in Mexico City caused the collapse of many
buildings in the 1985 earthquake.

Earthquake effects on buildings are seen in this animation: http://www.iris.edu/hq/files/programs/education_and_
outreach/aotm/6/SeismicBuilding-Narrated480.mov .

City Planning

In earthquake-prone areas, city planners try to reduce hazards. They look at both the likelihood of a quake and the
damage one would do. For example, in the San Francisco Bay Area, maps show how much shaking is expected for
different ground types ( Figure 5.47). This allows planners to locate new hospitals and schools more safely.

FIGURE 5.47
The expected Modiﬁed Mercalli Intensity
Scale for an earthquake of magnitude 7.1

Fault.

Summary

• Seismic waves rarely kill anyone. Structures falling on people and ﬁres or tsunamis after the earthquake cause

many more fatalities.

5.18 Earthquake Safe Structures

• Identify steps that can be taken to make buildings safer and avoid ﬁres in earthquake-prone areas.

Why is California Memorial Stadium called a "tectonic time bomb"?
The California Memorial Stadium is the home of football at the University of California, Berkeley. The site probably
looked ﬂat and easy to build on in 1922. But now scientists know that the Hayward Fault passes directly beneath
both end zones. The stadium has been renovated in a $321 million project. The renovation involved 10 miles of steel
cables, silicone ﬂuid-ﬁlled shock absorbers, concrete piers, 3-feet of sand, plastic sheeting, and stone columns. Go
Bears!

New Construction

New construction can be made safer in many ways:

• Skyscrapers and other large structures built on soft ground must be anchored to bedrock. Sometimes the

bedrock lies hundreds of meters below the ground surface.

• The correct building materials must be used. Houses should bend and sway. Wood and steel are better than

brick, stone, and adobe, which are brittle and will break.

• Larger buildings must sway, but not so much that they touch nearby buildings. Counterweights and diagonal

steel beams are used to hold down sway.

• Large buildings can be placed on rollers so that they move with the ground.

318

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes

• Buildings may be placed on layers of steel and rubber to absorb the shock of the waves.
• Connections, such as where the walls meet the foundation, must be made strong.
• In a multi-story building, the ﬁrst story must be well supported.

The Transamerica Building in San Francisco, pictured below, rests on a 52-foot deep steel and concrete foundation.
Steel rods reinforce the building internally and X-shaped trusses support it externally. In the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake, the building shook for more than a minute and swayed more than 12 inches in each direction, but was
not damaged.

FIGURE 5.48
The Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco is more stable in an earth-
quake or in high winds than a rectangular skyscraper.

Retroﬁtting

Older buildings can be made more earthquake safe by retroﬁtting. Steel or wood can be used to reinforce a building’s
structure and its connections. Elevated freeways and bridges can also be retroﬁtted so that they do not collapse (
Figure 5.49).

FIGURE 5.49
This bridge in San Diego, California, was built in 1931. It was retroﬁtted
and reopened in 2010 to meet earthquake standards.

5.18. Earthquake Safe Structures

Preventing Fire Damage

www.ck12.org

Fires often cause more damage than the earthquake. Fires start because seismic waves rupture gas and electrical
lines. Breaks in water mains make it difﬁcult to ﬁght the ﬁres ( Figure 5.50). The shapes of pipes can make a big
difference. Straight pipes will break in a quake. Builders zigzag pipes so that they bend and ﬂex when the ground
shakes. In San Francisco, water and gas pipelines are separated by valves. Areas can be isolated if one segment
breaks.

FIGURE 5.50
In the 1906 San Francisco earthquake,
ﬁre was much more destructive than the
ground shaking.

Making Choices

Strong, sturdy structures are expensive to build. Communities must decide how safe to make their buildings. They
must weigh how great the hazard is, what different building strategies will cost, and how much risk they are willing
to take.

• Identify how you can prepare for an earthquake.
• Describe ways to stay safe during and after an earthquake.

How can you prepare for an earthquake?
If you live in earthquake country, the actions you take before, during, and after a quake could make the difference in
your comfort for several days, or even your survival.

Protecting Yourself in an Earthquake

There are many things you can do to protect yourself before, during, and after an earthquake.

Before the Earthquake

• Have an engineer evaluate the house for structural integrity. Make sure the separate pieces—ﬂoor, walls, roof,

and foundation—are all well-attached to each other.

• Bracket or brace brick chimneys to the roof.
• Be sure that heavy objects are not stored in high places.
• Secure water heaters all around and at the top and bottom.
• Bolt heavy furniture onto walls with bolts, screws, or strap hinges.
• Replace halogen and incandescent light bulbs with ﬂuorescent bulbs to lessen ﬁre risk.
• Check to see that gas lines are made of ﬂexible material so that they do not rupture. Any equipment that uses

gas should be well-secured.

• Everyone in the household should know how to shut off the gas line.
• Prepare an earthquake kit with three days supply of water and food, a radio, and batteries.
• Place ﬂashlights all over the house and in the glove box of your car.
• Keep several ﬁre extinguishers around the house to ﬁght small ﬁres.
• Be sure to have a ﬁrst aid kit. Everyone should know basic ﬁrst aid and CPR.

322

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes

• Plan in advance how you will evacuate and where you will go. Do not plan on driving, as roadways will likely

be damaged.

During the Earthquake

• If you are in a building, get beneath a sturdy table, cover your head, and hold on.
• Stay away from windows, mirrors, and large furniture.
• If the building is structurally unsound, get outside as fast as possible.
• If you are outside, run to an open area away from buildings and power lines that may fall.
• If you are in a car, stay in the car and stay away from structures that might collapse, such as overpasses,

bridges, or buildings.

After the Earthquake

• Be aware that aftershocks, smaller quakes that come after the main trembler, are likely.
• Avoid dangerous areas like hillsides that may experience a landslide.
• Turn off water and power to your home.
• Call 911 only if there is a real emergency. Many people will be trying to get through to emergency services.
• Be prepared to wait for help or instructions. Assist others as necessary.

Summary

• Before an earthquake, be sure that your home is secure. Be sure that you have supplies to last a few days.
• During an earthquake, get to a safe place.
• After an earthquake, avoid dangerous situations, wait for instructions, and assist as necessary.

5.20 Volcano Characteristics

• Deﬁne volcano.
• Discuss volcano locations and stages.

Is Earth the only planet to have volcanoes?
On Earth, active volcanoes are found on all continents except Australia. Volcanoes even erupt under the ice on
Antarctica! Volcanoes are also common elsewhere in the solar system. In fact, the biggest volcano is on Mars. This
image is of Olympus Mons, which is a shield volcano. Olympus Mons is three times the height of Mt. Everest. But
its slopes are very gentle.

Volcanoes

A volcano is a vent from which the material from a magma chamber escapes. This may include lava, rock fragments,
ash, and gases. Volcanic eruptions can come from many types of structures. Most people think of volcanoes as large,
peaky cones. But volcanoes can be large and broad, or tiny little cones. Volcanic eruptions can come from fractured
domes, a vent in the ground, or from a giant hole in the ground.

325

5.20. Volcano Characteristics

Where They Are

www.ck12.org

Volcanoes are a vibrant manifestation of plate tectonics processes. Volcanoes are common along convergent and
divergent plate boundaries. They are also found within lithospheric plates at hotspots. Wherever mantle is able to
melt, volcanoes are likely to be the result.
The Paciﬁc Ocean basin is a good place to look for different types of volcanoes. The light blue wavy line that goes up
the right-center of the diagram is the East Paciﬁc Rise. The rise is made of volcanoes at a divergent plate boundary.
Trenches due to subduction are on the west and east sides of the basin. Subduction creates island arcs that are seen
in the Western Paciﬁc. Subduction also creates continental arcs seen along Central and South America. Hawaii is
the line of volcanoes trending southeast-northwest near the center-top of the image ( Figure 5.51). The Hawaiian
volcanoes are due to a hotspot.

FIGURE 5.51
Volcanoes at divergent plate boundaries
are in the East Paciﬁc Rise. Conver-
gent plate boundaries, where there are
trenches, have volcanoes. Hotspot vol-
canoes are in chains in the middle of the
ocean basin.

Creating Magma

Volcanoes erupt because mantle rock melts. This is the ﬁrst stage in creating a volcano. How can rock melt? One
way is if the temperature rises. Another way is if the pressure on the rock decreases; this will lower the rock’s
melting temperature. The melting temperature of a rock also goes down if water is added. Every time there is a
volcanic eruption, one or more of these things happens. For each type of volcano mentioned in these concepts, think
about how and why melting occurs.

Stages

Of all the volcanoes in the world, very few are erupting at any given time. Scientists question whether a volcano that
is not erupting will ever erupt again and then describe it as active, dormant, or extinct.

• Active: Currently erupting or showing signs of erupting soon.
• Dormant: No current activity, but has erupted recently.
• Extinct: No activity for some time; will probably not erupt again.

Summary

• Volcanoes are located along convergent and divergent plate boundaries. They can be found in the middle of

plates at hot spots.

• Magma can be created when temperature rises, pressure lowers, or water is added.
• Volcanoes may be active, dormant, or extinct. This depends on whether there is the possibility of magma in

their magma chambers.

5.21 Volcanoes at Plate Boundaries

• Describe volcanic activity at convergent and divergent plate boundaries.
• Explain why volcanic activity occurs at these plate boundaries.

What good are plate boundaries?
Plate boundaries create natural resources, such as gold. But plate boundaries also create beautiful scenery like
mountains. Volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries can be beautiful to look at. They can also be beautiful to visit
or even climb!

Convergent Plate Boundaries

Converging plates can be oceanic, continental, or one of each. If at least one is oceanic, it will subduct. A subducting
plate creates volcanoes. Many of the world’s volcanoes are the result of subduction at a convergent plate boundary.
A map of the world’s active volcanoes is pictured below ( Figure 5.53).

Melting

Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers
the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain
why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks
into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct,
the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When
the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or
continental arc.

Chapter 5. Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes

FIGURE 5.53
World map of active volcanoes.

Paciﬁc Rim

Convergent plate boundaries are found around much of the Paciﬁc Ocean basin. Trenches mark subduction zones.
Volcanoes are found in an arc above those subduction zones.
The Cascades ( Figure 5.54) are a chain of volcanoes at a convergent boundary. In this region, an oceanic plate is
subducting beneath a continental plate.
The Cascades have been active for 27 million years. The mountains we see today are no more than 2 million years
old. The volcanoes receive a lot of winter snow, and many are covered by glaciers ( Figure 5.55).
The Cascades are shown on this interactive map with photos and descriptions of each of the volcanoes: http://www.i
ris.edu/hq/files/programs/education_and_outreach/aotm/interactive/6.Volcanoes4Rollover.swf .

Divergent plate boundaries

At divergent plate boundaries hot mantle rock rises into the space where the plates are moving apart. As the hot
mantle rock rises, it goes from higher to lower pressure. This is because there is no longer the weight of all the rock
above it. Lower pressure lowers the melting temperature of the rock (2 in the previous section). This is why there is
volcanism at divergent plate boundaries. Lava erupts through long cracks in the ground, or ﬁssures.

Mid-Ocean Ridges

Volcanoes erupt at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge. Seaﬂoor spreading creates new seaﬂoor in the
rift valleys. This type of volcanism makes all of the ocean ﬂoor! Where a hotspot is located along the ridge, such as
at Iceland, volcanoes grow high enough to create islands ( Figure 5.56).

Continental Rifting

Eruptions are found at divergent plate boundaries as continents break apart, known as continental rifting. The
Mount Gahinga volcanoes ( Figure 5.57) are in the East African Rift between the African and Arabian plates. Baja
California is breaking apart from mainland Mexico, also by continental rifting.

Summary

• Subduction at convergent plate boundaries leads to melting and volcanoes.
• Convergent plate boundaries line the Paciﬁc Ocean basin so that volcanic arcs line the region.
• Melting at divergent plate boundaries is due to release of pressure.
• At mid-ocean ridges seaﬂoor is pulled apart and new seaﬂoor is created. Rifting in a continent can create a

new ocean eventually.

5.22 Volcanoes at Hotspots

• Describe hotspots and the volcanic activity they create.

What does an intraplate eruption look like?
The Hawaiian Islands are formed from a hotspot beneath the Paciﬁc Ocean. Volcanoes grow above the hotspot. Lava
ﬂows down the hillsides, and some of it reaches the ocean, causing the islands to grow. Too hot now, but a great
place in the future for beach lovers!

Volcanic Hotspots

Some volcanoes form over active hotspots. Scientists count about 50 hotspots on the Earth. Hotspots lie directly
above a column of hot rock called a mantle plume. Mantle plumes continuously bring hot rock up from the mantle
toward the crust ( Figure 5.58). The rock melts due to the release of pressure.
Hotspots may be in the middle of a tectonic plate. They create intraplate volcanoes.

FIGURE 5.58
Mantle plumes are found all over the
world, especially in the ocean basins. The
size of the eruptions is different at differ-
ent plumes.

Hotspots in the Oceans

Hotspots are much more common beneath ocean crust. This is because ocean crust is thinner. The plume can more
easily penetrate this crust. As the tectonic plates move above a hotspot, they form a chain of volcanoes. The islands
of Hawaii formed over a hotspot in the middle of the Paciﬁc plate. The volcanoes are massive shield volcanoes that
together create the islands. The lavas are maﬁc and have low viscosity. These lavas produce beautiful ropy ﬂows
of p¯ahoehoe and clinkery ﬂows of a’a. These lava types will be described in more detail in the concept "Effusive
Eruptions."
The Hawaii hotspot has been active for tens of millions of years. The volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands formed at
this hotspot. Older volcanoes that formed at the hotspot have eroded below sea level. These are called the Emperor
Seamounts.
Loihi seamount is currently active beneath the water southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii. One day, the volcano
will rise above sea level. Loihi will join the volcanoes of the island or create a new island ( Figure 5.59).

Hotspots may also be active at plate boundaries. This is especially common at mid-ocean ridges. Iceland is formed
by a hotspot along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

Hotspots within Continents

Hotspots are found within continents, but not as commonly as within oceans. They are not common because it takes
a massive mantle plume to penetrate the thick continental crust. Eruptions from these hotspots are rare but massive.
The Yellowstone hotspot is a famous example of a continental hotspot.

Summary

• Volcanoes grow above hotspots. A hotspot is a zone of melting above a mantle plume.
• Hotspot volcanoes are better able to penetrate oceanic crust than continental crust. We see many more hotspot

volcanoes in the oceans.

• Shield volcanoes commonly form above hotspots in the oceans.

5.23 Magma Composition at Volcanoes

• Describe types of magma composition.
• Explain the effect of magma composition on types of eruptions.
• Compare magma to lava.

Are all volcanic eruptions alike?
The type of eruption a volcano has depends on the type of magma in its chamber. Some eruptions are explosive.
Some eruptions are quiet. All eruptions are amazing!

Magma

Magma forms deep beneath the Earth’s surface. Rock melts below the surface under tremendous pressure and high
temperatures. Molten rock ﬂows like taffy or hot wax. Most magmas are formed at temperatures between 600oC
and 1300oC ( Figure 5.60).
Magma collects in magma chambers beneath Earth’s surface. Magma chambers are located where the heat and
pressure are great enough to melt rock. These locations are at divergent or convergent plate boundaries or at hotpots.
The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms. The chemistry also determines how the
magma moves. The higher the amount of silica in the magma, the higher the viscosity. Viscosity is a liquid’s
resistance to ﬂow. Viscous magmas tend to stay below the surface or erupt explosively. These are felsic magmas,
which are high in silica. When magma is ﬂuid and runny, it is not viscous. This magma often reaches the surface by
ﬂowing out in rivers of lava. These are low-silica maﬁc magmas.

Lava

The way lava ﬂows depends on what it is made of. Thick lava doesn’t ﬂow easily. It may block the vent of a volcano.
If the lava traps a lot of gas, the pressure builds up. After the pressure becomes greater and greater, the volcano

stone.

ﬁnally explodes. Ash and pyroclasts shoot up into the air. Pumice, with small holes in solid rock, shows where gas
bubbles were when the rock was still molten.
Fluid lava ﬂows down mountainsides. The rock that the ﬂow becomes depends on which type of lava it is and where
it cools. The three types of ﬂows are a’a, pahoehoe, and pillow lava.

• A’a lava is the thickest of the non-explosive lavas. A’a forms a thick and brittle crust, which is torn into rough,
rubbly pieces. The solidiﬁed surface is angular, jagged, and sharp ( Figure 5.61). A’a can spread over large
areas as the lava continues to ﬂow underneath.

FIGURE 5.61
A’a ﬂows can also be found in Hawaii and are much sharper and more
jagged than pahoehoe.

• P¯ahoehoe lava is thinner than a’a, and ﬂows more readily.

Its surface looks more wrinkly and smooth.
P¯ahoehoe lava ﬂows in a series of lobes that form strange, twisted shapes and natural rock sculptures ( Figure
5.62). P¯ahoehoe lava can form lava tubes. The outer layer of the lava ﬂow cools and solidiﬁes. The inner part
of the ﬂow remains ﬂuid. The ﬂuid lava ﬂows through and leaves behind a tube.

• Pillow lava is created from lava that enters the water. The volcanic vent may be underwater. The lava may
ﬂow over land and enter the water ( Figure 5.63). Once in the water, the lava cools very quickly. The lava
forms round rocks that resemble pillows. Pillow lava is particularly common along mid-ocean ridges.

Summary

• Magmas differ in composition, which affects viscosity. Magma composition has a large effect on how a

volcano erupts.

• Felsic lavas are more viscous and erupt explosively or do not erupt. Maﬁc lavas are less viscous and erupt

effusively.

• Different lava types create different rock types, such as pahoehoe and a’a. Lavas that cool underwater become

pillow lavas.

5.24 Explosive Eruptions

• Describe the causes and effects of explosive volcanic eruptions.
• Deﬁne lahar, pyroclast, and pyroclastic ﬂow.

What would cause a giant explosion like this one?
The type of eruption a volcano has depends on the composition of the magma. Silica-rich, felsic magma can trap a
lot of gas. So these magmas produce explosive eruptions. Silica-poor maﬁc magmas trap little gas. These magmas
produce quiet eruptions. Which type of eruption do you think is safest to be near?

Eruptions

All volcanoes share the same basic features. First, mantle rock melts. The molten rock collects in magma chambers
that can be 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface. As the rock heats, it expands. The hot rock is less dense
than the surrounding rock. The magma rises toward the surface through cracks in the crust. A volcanic eruption
occurs when the magma reaches the surface. Lava can reach the surface gently or explosively.

341

5.24. Explosive Eruptions

Explosive Eruptions

www.ck12.org

An explosive eruption produces huge clouds of volcanic ash. Chunks of the volcano ﬂy high into the atmosphere.
Explosive eruptions can be tens of thousands of times as powerful as an atomic bomb ( Figure 5.64). Hot magma
beneath the surface mixes with water. This forms gases. The gas pressure grows until it must be released. The
volcano erupts in an enormous explosion.

FIGURE 5.64
Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland spewed
ash into the atmosphere in 2010. This
was a fairly small eruption, but it disrupted
air travel across Europe for six days.

Ash and particles shoot many kilometers into the sky. The material may form a mushroom cloud, just like a nuclear
explosion. Hot fragments of rock, called pyroclasts, ﬂy up into the air at very high speeds. The pyroclasts cool in
the atmosphere. Some ash may stay in the atmosphere for years. The ash may block out sunlight. This changes
weather patterns and affects the temperature of the Earth. For a year or two after a large eruption, sunsets may be
especially beautiful worldwide.
Volcanic gases can form poisonous, invisible clouds. The poisonous gases may be toxic close to the eruption. The
gases may cause environmental problems like acid rain and ozone destruction.

Mt. St. Helens

In 1980, Mount St. Helens, located between Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington, erupted explosively. The
eruption killed 57 people, destroyed 250 homes, and swept away 47 bridges. The volcano blew off its top so that it
lost over 400 meters (1,300 feet) of height. Mt. St. Helens is still active ( Figure 5.65). Within the crater, a new lava
dome formed.

FIGURE 5.65

1980. Mt. Adams is in the background

Helens blew down acres of trees like they
were toothpicks.

342

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes

Much of the damage in the eruption was due to pyroclastic ﬂows. Pyroclastic ﬂows of pyroclasts and ash knock
down everything in their path. The temperature inside a pyroclastic ﬂow may be as high as 1,000°C (1,800°F).
A pyroclastic ﬂow at Montserrat volcano is seen in this video: http://faculty.gg.uwyo.edu/heller/SedMovs/Sed%20
Movie%20ﬁles/PyroclasticFlow.MOV .
Lahars are mixtures of ash and water that travel down river valleys. On Mount St. Helens, the eruption melted
glaciers. The water mixed with ash from the eruption and created tremendous lahars. The lahars raced down valleys
and knocked out many bridges.
Mt St. Helens was not a very large eruption for the Cascades. Mt. Mazama blew itself apart in an eruption about
42 times more powerful than Mount St. Helens in 1980. Today all that remains of that huge stratovolcano is Crater
Lake ( Figure 5.66 and Figure 5.67).

FIGURE 5.66

lapsed Mt. Mazama. The bathymetry of
the lake shows volcanic features such as
cinder cones.

Summary

• Felsic magmas erupt explosively, creating pyroclastic eruptions.
• Pyroclastic eruption types include tephra, ash, and lahars.
• Mt. Mazama blew its top off and then collapsed, creating Crater Lake in Oregon.

5.25 Effusive Eruptions

• Describe the causes and effects of effusive volcanic eruptions.

Isn’t this an explosive eruption?
This is a strombolian eruption. This type of eruption was named for Mt. Stromboli in Italy. Strombolian eruptions
spew lava into the air. But these eruptions do not have a massive explosion. They create lava ﬂows.

Effusive Eruptions

Maﬁc magma creates gentler effusive eruptions. There is little or no gas. The lava is thin and ﬂuid so that it
ﬂows over the ground like a river. Maﬁc magma pushes toward the surface through ﬁssures. Eventually, the magma
reaches the surface and erupts through a vent ( Figure 5.68). Effusive eruptions are common in Hawaii, where lavas
are maﬁc.

Effusive Eruptions Damage

Effusive eruptions rarely kill anyone because they move slowly. People can usually be evacuated before an effusive
eruption. Still, effusive eruptions can be destructive. There is not much anyone can do to stop a lava ﬂow from
destroying a building or road ( Figure 5.69).

Summary

• Maﬁc magma creates effusive eruptions. The pressure builds but the lava ﬂows fairly quietly.
• Effusive eruptions cause damage but rarely kill anyone.
• Maﬁc magma cools into different types of ﬂows like a’a, p¯ahoehoe, and pillow lava.

5.26 Predicting Volcanic Eruptions

• Explain how scientists attempt to predict volcanic eruptions.

What is one of the deadliest science jobs?
No one can predict exactly when a volcanic eruption will take place. There are clues, but no one knows exactly
when. Sometimes a volcano will erupt when scientists are studying it. Volcanologists have a high fatality rate
among scientists because forecasting eruptions is so difﬁcult.

Predicting Volcanic Eruptions

Volcanic eruptions can be devastating, particularly to the people who live close to volcanoes. Volcanologists study
volcanoes to be able to predict when a volcano will erupt. Many changes happen when a volcano is about to erupt.
Even so, eruptions are very difﬁcult to predict.

History of Volcanic Activities

Scientists study a volcano’s history to try to predict when it will next erupt. They want to know how long it has been
since it last erupted. They also want to know the time span between its previous eruptions. Scientists watch both
active and dormant volcanoes closely for signs that show they might erupt.

348

www.ck12.org

Chapter 5. Geological Activity from Plate Tectonics Processes

FIGURE 5.70
Mount Rainier in Washington State is currently dormant. The volcano
could, and probably will erupt again.

Earthquakes

Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes
increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on
neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a
volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake.

Slope Tilt

All that magma and gas pushing upward can make the volcano’s slope begin to swell. Ground swelling may change
the shape of a volcano or cause rock falls and landslides. Most of the time, the ground tilting is not visible. Scientists
detect it by using tiltmeters, which are instruments that measure the angle of the slope of a volcano.

Gases

Scientists measure the gases that escape from a volcano to predict eruptions. Gases like sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon
dioxide (CO2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water vapor can be measured at the site. Gases may also be measured
from satellites. The amounts of gases and the ratios of gases are calculated to help predict eruptions.

Remote Monitoring

Satellites can be used to monitor more than just gases ( Figure 5.71). Satellites can look for high temperature spots
or areas where the volcano surface is changing. This allows scientists to detect changes accurately and safely.

Costs and Beneﬁts of Predictions

No scientist or government agency wants to announce an eruption and then be wrong. There is a very real cost
and disruption to society during a large-scale evacuation. If the scientists are wrong, people would be less likely to
evacuate the next time scientists predicted an eruption. But if scientists predict an eruption that does take place, it
could save many lives.

Summary

• Volcanologists use several lines of evidence to try to forecast volcanic eruptions.
• Magma moving beneath a volcano will cause earthquakes and slope deformation. Gases may be released from

the magma out of the volcano vent.

• Deciding whether to call for an evacuation is very tricky.

5.27 Types of Volcanoes

• Describe the characteristics of different types of volcanoes.

What does an active volcano look like?
Climbing up Mount St. Helens and looking into the crater at the steaming dome is an incredible experience. The
slope is steep and the landscape is like something from another planet. Nothing’s alive up there, except maybe a
bird. When you’re standing on the top, you can see other Cascades volcanoes: Mt. Adams, Rainier, Hood, Jefferson,
and sometimes more.

Volcanoes

A volcano is a vent through which molten rock and gas escape from a magma chamber. Volcanoes differ in many
features, such as height, shape, and slope steepness. Some volcanoes are tall cones, and others are just cracks in the
ground ( Figure 5.72). As you might expect, the shape of a volcano is related to the composition of its magma. The
three types of volcanoes are composite, shield, and cinder cones.

Composite Volcanoes

Figure 5.72 shows Mt. Fuji, a classic example of a composite volcano. Composite volcanoes have broad bases and
steep sides. These volcanoes usually have a large crater at the top. The crater was created during the volcano’s last
eruption.
Composite volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes. This is because they are formed by alternating layers (strata)
of magma and ash ( Figure 5.73). The magma that creates composite volcanoes tends to be thick. The steep sides
form because the lava cannot ﬂow too far from the vent. The thick magma may also create explosive eruptions.
Ash and pyroclasts erupt into the air. Much of this material falls back down near the vent. This creates the steep

sides of stratovolcanoes. The composition of magma that erupts at composite volcanoes is usually felsic (rhyolite)
or intermediate (andesite).

FIGURE 5.73
A cross section of a composite volcano reveals alternating layers of rock
and ash. Frequently there is a large crater at the top from the last
eruption.

Composite volcanoes are common along convergent plate boundaries. When a tectonic plate subducts, it melts. This
creates the thick magma needed for these eruptions. The Paciﬁc Ring of Fire is dotted by composite volcanoes.

Shield Volcanoes

FIGURE 5.74
Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii.

Shield volcanoes look like a huge ancient warrior’s shield laid down. Pictured above is Mauna Kea Volcano ( Figure
5.74) taken from Mauna Loa Volcano. Both volcanoes are part of the Big Island of Hawaii. A shield volcano has
a very wide base. It is much ﬂatter on the top than a composite volcano. The lava that creates shield volcanoes is
relatively thin. The thin lava spreads out. This builds a large, ﬂat volcano, layer by layer. The composition of lava
at shield volcanoes is maﬁc. Shield volcanoes are very large. For example, the Mauna Loa Volcano has a diameter
of more than 112 kilometers (70 miles). The volcano forms a signiﬁcant part of the island of Hawaii. The top of
nearby Mauna Kea Volcano is more than ten kilometers (6 miles) from its base on the seaﬂoor.
Shield volcanoes often form along divergent plate boundaries. They also form at hotspots, like Hawaii. Shield
volcano eruptions are non-explosive.

Cinder Cones

Cinder cones are the smallest and most common type of volcano. Cinder cones have steep sides like composite
volcanoes. But they are much smaller, rarely reaching even 300 meters in height. Cinder cones usually have a crater
at the summit. Cinder cones are composed of small fragments of rock, called cinders. The cinders are piled on top
of one another. The cinders can be maﬁc, intermediate, or felsic in composition. These volcanoes usually do not
produce streams of lava. Cinder cones often form near larger volcanoes. Most composite and shield volcanoes have
nearby cinder cones.
Cinder cones usually build up very rapidly. They only erupt for a short time. Many only produce one eruption. For
this reason, cinder cones do not reach the sizes of stratovolcanoes or shield volcanoes ( Figure 5.75).

FIGURE 5.75
A cinder cone volcano in Lassen National Park.

Summary

• Magma composition determines both eruption type and volcano type.
• Composite volcanoes are common at convergent boundaries. Shield volcanoes are produced at divergent plate

boundaries and intraplate.

• Cinder cones are made of small fragments of a variety of compositions usually from a single eruption. They

are found with composite and shield volcanoes.

5.28 Supervolcanoes

• Describe the characteristics of supervolcanoes and their eruptions.

Is this a supervolcano?
Lake Toba in Indonesia is 100 km (62 mi) by 30 km (19 mi). The water ﬁlls a giant caldera created by a supervolcano.
The eruption took place about 75,000 years ago, Earth’s largest eruption in the past 25 million years. So much
material was ejected into space that there was a 6- to 10-year volcanic winter. Some scientists think that only 10,000
humans survived worldwide. The numbers of other mammals also plummeted.

Calderas

During a massive eruption, all of the material may be ejected from a magma changer. Without support, the mountain
above the empty chamber may collapse. This produces a huge caldera. Calderas are generally round, bowl-shaped
formations ( Figure 5.76).

Supervolcanoes

Supervolcano eruptions are extremely rare in Earth’s history. It’s a good thing because they are unimaginably large.
A supervolcano must erupt more than 1,000 cubic km (240 cubic miles) of material. Imagine how large that is
compared with 1.2 km3 for Mount St. Helens. Mount Pinatubo, a large eruption in the Philippines in 1991, erupted
only 25 km3 of material. Not surprisingly, supervolcanoes are the most dangerous type of volcano.

Crater Lake, Oregon is the remnant of Mount Mazama. After an enormous
eruption the mountain collapsed, forming a caldera. Crater Lake should
actually be named Caldera Lake. Wizard Island, within the lake, is a cinder
cone.

Supervolcano Eruptions

The exact cause of supervolcano eruptions is still debated. However, scientists think that a very large magma
chamber erupts entirely in one catastrophic explosion. This creates a caldera into which the surface collapses (
Figure 5.77). The composition of the eruption is felsic or highly felsic.

FIGURE 5.77
The caldera at Santorini in Greece is so large that it can only be seen by
satellite.

Yellowstone Caldera

The largest supervolcano in North America is beneath Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. Much of the national
park lies within the enormous Yellowstone Caldera. It is so large that you can stand on one rim and not see the other
side.
Yellowstone sits above a hotspot that has erupted catastrophically three times: 2.1 million, 1.3 million, and 640,000
years ago. Yellowstone has produced many smaller (but still enormous) eruptions more recently ( Figure 5.79).
Fortunately, current activity at Yellowstone is limited to the region’s famous geysers. No one knows when the
supervolcano will erupt again.

Supervolcano Eruptions and Life on Earth

A supervolcano could change life on Earth as we know it. Ash could block sunlight so much that photosynthesis
would be reduced and global temperatures would plummet. Volcanic eruptions could have contributed to some of
the mass extinctions in our planet’s history. No one knows when the next super eruption will be.
Interesting volcano videos are seen on National Geographic Videos, Environment Video, Natural Disasters, Earth-
quakes: http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/player/environment/

particularly interesting; it explores Hot Creek and the volcanic area it is a part of in California.

5.29 Volcanic Landforms

• Describe the landforms created by volcanic activity.

Why does this massive rock stick out like this?
Shiprock in New Mexico is visible for many miles around. Shiprock is the neck of an old volcano. The magma
cooled into a rock that was harder than the surrounding volcano. So the volcano eroded away and left the neck. The
peak is on the land of the Navajo Nation, for whom it has great religious signiﬁcance.

Landforms from Lava

Extrusive igneous rocks cool at the surface. Volcanoes are one type of feature that forms from extrusive rocks.
Several other interesting landforms are also extrusive features.
Intrusive igneous rocks cool below the surface.
These rocks do not always remain hidden. Rocks that formed in the crust are exposed when the rock and sediment
that covers them is eroded away.

Volcanoes and Vents

The most obvious landforms created by lava are volcanoes. These are mostly cinder cones, composite volcanoes,
and shield volcanoes. Eruptions also take place through other types of vents, commonly from ﬁssures ( Figure 5.80).
The eruptions that created the entire ocean ﬂoor are essentially ﬁssure eruptions.

Lava Domes

When lava is thick, it ﬂows slowly. If thick lava makes it to the surface, it cannot ﬂow far from the vent. It often
stays right in the middle of a crater at the top of a volcano. Here the lava creates a large, round lava dome ( Figure
5.81).

land.

FIGURE 5.81
The Mono Craters in California are lava
domes.

Lava ﬂows often make mounds right in the middle of craters at the top of volcanoes ( Figure 5.82).

Lava Plateaus

A lava plateau is made of a large amount of ﬂuid lava. The lava ﬂows over a large area and cools. This creates a
large, ﬂat surface of igneous rock. Lava plateaus may be huge. The Columbia Plateau covers over 161,000 square
kilometers (63,000 square miles). It makes up parts of the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho ( Figure 5.83).

Land

New land is created in volcanic eruptions. The Hawaiian Islands are shield volcanoes. These volcanoes formed from
ﬂuid lava ( Figure 5.84). The island grows as lava is added on the coast. New land may also emerge from lava that
erupts from beneath the water. This is one way that new land is created.

than 161,000 square kilometers (63,000

Landforms from Magma

Magma that cools underground forms intrusions ( Figure 5.85). Usually this magma is very viscous felsic magma.
This magma does not rise easily and so cools slowly underground. Intrusions become land formations if they are
exposed at the surface by uplift and erosion.

Summary

• Landforms created by lava include volcanoes, domes, and plateaus.
• New land can be created by volcanic eruptions.
• Landforms created by magma include volcanic necks and domes.

www.ck12.org

5.30 Hot Springs and Geysers

• Deﬁne hot springs and geysers.
• Explain how hot springs and geysers work.

Hot spring, anyone?
Hot water from underground can pool at hot springs. Even some animals enjoy relaxing in nature’s hot tubs. Care
to join them?

Hot Springs and Geysers

Water sometimes comes into contact with hot rock. The water may emerge at the surface as either a hot spring or a
geyser.

Hot Springs

When hot water gently rises to the surface, it creates a hot spring. A hot spring forms where a crack in the Earth
allows water to reach the surface after being heated underground. Many hot springs are used by people and animals
as natural hot tubs ( Figure 5.86). Some people believe that hot springs can cure illnesses. Hot springs are found all
over the world, even in Antarctica!

Geysers

Geysers are also created by water that is heated beneath the Earth’s surface. The water may become superheated by
magma. It becomes trapped in a narrow passageway. The heat and pressure build as more water is added. When the
pressure is too much, the superheated water bursts out onto the surface. This is a geyser.

FIGURE 5.86
Even in winter, the water in this hot spring
in Yellowstone doesn’t

treme cold.

freeze.

There are only a few areas in the world where the conditions are right for the formation of geysers. Only about 1,000
geysers exist worldwide. About half of them are in the United States. The most famous geyser is Old Faithful at
Yellowstone National Park. The geyser erupts every 60 to 70 minutes, shooting hot water nearly 60 meters in the
air. It is rare for a geyser to erupt so regularly, which is why Old Faithful is famous. Castle Geyser ( Figure 5.87) is
another geyser at Yellowstone Park; however, it does not erupt as frequently or predictably as Old Faithful.

FIGURE 5.87
Castle Geyser is one of the many gey-
sers at Yellowstone National Park. Castle
erupts regularly, but not as frequently or
predictably as Old Faithful.

The Old Faithful web cam shows periodic eruptions of Yellowstone’s famous geyser in real time: http://www.nps.g
ov/features/yell/live/live4.htm

Summary

• When magma heats groundwater, it may come to the surface as a hot spring or a geyser.
• Geysers erupt because the water is trapped. The water becomes superheated until ﬁnally the pressure builds

enough for it to break the seal.

• Yellowstone is famous for its geysers. Old Faithful erupts the most regularly.

Summary

Plate tectonic processes explain why we see many types of geological activity where we do. Stresses build up in
some locations. These stresses may cause folding or faulting. Earthquakes strike along all three types of plate
boundaries. The most damaging earthquakes are shallow focus. People in earthquake-prone regions must be
aware of the potential damage from earthquakes. Seismologists have scales for measuring earthquake intensity
and magnitude. Cities in earthquake zones must build safe structures. They also have guidelines for being safe
in earthquakes. Earthquakes are often associated with volcanoes. Volcanoes erupt at all types of plate boundaries
except transform. Volcanic eruptions can be quiet or explosive. Volcanoes have a variety of shapes. The shapes
range from large shields, to classic peaks, to small cones. Supervolcano eruptions are rare but extremely deadly.
Volcanic activity creates unique landforms. Hot springs and geysers result when water meets hot rock below ground.
Some geological activity, both earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, is located away from plate boundaries.

Introduction

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

How does Earth’s water move?
When astronauts see Earth from space, this is how it looks. Notice how blue the planet appears. That’s because
oceans cover much of Earth’s surface. The water in those oceans is in constant motion. Water is also found in the
clouds that rise above the planet and travel across the sky. The water may precipitate out as rain or snow. Water
passes through soil and into groundwater. Or it is taken up by the leaves of plants and then enters the atmosphere.
Water moves into and out of animals. Water may remain as ice in a glacier for thousands of years. This chapter is
about Earth’s most dynamic substance: water.

6.1 Distribution of Water on Earth

• Know where Earth’s water is located.

Where is Earth’s Water?
Here’s a photo of Earth from space again. It’s pretty easy to see where most of Earth’s water is. It’s in the oceans.
Nearly all of Earth’s water is in the seas. Although it’s extremely useful for ocean ecosystems, it’s not very useful
for people. So where is the water that we can use?

Where Is Earth’s Freshwater?

Most of Earth’s water is salt water in the oceans. As seen below, only 3 percent of Earth’s water is fresh ( Figure
6.1). Freshwater is water that contains little or no dissolved salt. Most freshwater is frozen in ice caps and glaciers.
Glaciers cover the peaks of some tall mountains. For example, the Cascades Mountains in North America and the
Alps Mountains in Europe are capped with ice. Ice caps cover vast areas of Antarctica and Greenland. Chunks of
ice frequently break off ice caps. They form icebergs that ﬂoat in the oceans.
Only a tiny fraction of Earth’s freshwater is in the liquid state. Most liquid freshwater is under the ground in layers
of rock. Of freshwater on the surface, the majority occurs in lakes and soil. What percentage of freshwater on the
surface is found in living things?
Water can remain in a particular location for a long time. This is known as a reservoir. Reservoirs for water include
oceans, glaciers, ponds, or even the atmosphere. A water molecule may pass through a reservoir very quickly or
may remain for much longer. The amount of time a molecule stays in a reservoir is known as its residence time.

What percentage of Earth’s surface fresh-
water is water vapor in the air?

The residence time of water in the ocean is 3,200 years. Of course, not every molecule stays that long. That number
is an average for all molecules.

Summary

• Of Earth’s water, 97% is in the oceans.
• Of the remaining 3%, much is trapped in ice and glaciers.
• A substance is stored in a reservoir. The amount of time it stays in that reservoir is its residence time.

• Identify the three states of water.

What are the three states of water in this photo?
Water is present as liquid, solid, and gas in this photo. We take water for granted here on Earth because there is a lot
of it!

The Water Molecule

A molecule of water ( Figure 6.2) is made of three atoms bonded together. Two of these atoms are hydrogen and
one atom is oxygen. The hydrogen ions have a positive electrical charge. The oxygen atom has a negative electrical
charge. The hydrogen atoms are located on one side and the oxygen atom on the other. This means that the side with
the hydrogen ions has a slightly positive charge. The other side, the side without the hydrogen ions, has a slightly
negative charge. The water molecule is a polar molecule.
Water has remarkable properties. Water expands when it freezes, even though all other substances contract. This
means that in the winter ice on a pond or lake will ﬂoat. Water has high surface tension because polar molecules
tend to stick together. That’s why drops stick together or some bugs can walk on the surface of a pond. Without
water, life might not be able to exist on Earth. If it did exist, it would not be as diverse or as complex.

Three States of Matter

Water is the only substance on Earth that is present in all three states of matter. This means that water is present as
a solid, liquid, and gas. Earth is the only planet where water is present in all three states. All three phases may be
present in a single location or in a region. The three phases are solid (ice or snow), liquid (water), and gas ( water
vapor). See ice, water, and clouds pictured below ( Figure 6.3).

Summary

• Water is a polar molecule. On one side there is a positive electrical charge. On the other side there is a negative

charge.

• Water is the only substance on Earth that is stable in all three states.
• Earth is the only planet in the solar system that has water in all three states.

www.ck12.org

6.3 Processes of the Water Cycle

• Describe reservoirs of the water cycle.
• Describe the processes that carry water between reservoirs.

Where have these water molecules been?
Did you ever wonder where the water molecules you drink came from? Were some of the molecules trapped in a
glacier? Flowing along the bottom of the ocean? Up high in a thundercloud? Maybe a water molecule that you drink
today once quenched the thirst of a dinosaur. It’s all entirely possible.

The Water Cycle

The water cycle ( Figure 6.4) is the movement of water through the oceans, atmosphere, land, and living things.
The water cycle is powered by energy from the Sun.
Water keeps cycling. The water cycle repeats over and over again. Each water molecule has probably been around
for billions of years. That’s because Earth’s water is constantly recycled.

Processes in the Water Cycle

Water keeps changing state as it goes through the water cycle. This means that it can be a solid, liquid, or gas.
How does water change state? How does it keep moving through the cycle? As seen above ( Figure 6.4), several
processes are involved.

• Evaporation changes liquid water to water vapor. Energy from the Sun causes water to evaporate. Most
evaporation is from the oceans because they cover so much area. The water vapor rises into the atmosphere.

378

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

FIGURE 6.4
The water cycle has no beginning or end.
Water just keeps moving along.

• Transpiration is like evaporation because it changes liquid water to water vapor.

In transpiration, plants

release water vapor through their leaves ( Figure 6.5). This water vapor rises into the atmosphere.

FIGURE 6.5
Liquid water is taken up by plant roots. The plant releases water vapor
into the atmosphere. This is transpiration.

• Condensation changes water vapor to liquid water. As air rises higher into the atmosphere, it cools. Cool air
can hold less water vapor than warm air. So some of the water vapor condenses into water droplets. Water
droplets may form clouds. Below is an example of condensation ( Figure 6.6).

• Precipitation is water that falls from clouds to Earth’s surface. Water droplets in clouds fall to Earth when
they become too large to stay aloft. The water falls as rain if the air is warm. If the air is cold, the water may
freeze and fall as snow, sleet, or hail. Most precipitation falls into the oceans. Some falls on land.

• Runoff is precipitation that ﬂows over the surface of the land. This water may travel to a river, lake, or ocean.
Runoff may pick up fertilizer and other pollutants and deliver them to a water body. In this way, runoff may
pollute bodies of water.

• Inﬁltration is the process by which water soaks into the ground. Some of the water may seep deep under-

ground. Some may stay in the soil, where plants can absorb it with their roots.

Summary

• The water cycle recognizes all of the reservoirs of water.

It also describes the processes that carry water

between the reservoirs.

6.4 Uses of Water

• Describe the different ways in which humans use water.

Dynamic Earth and dynamic human development come together—where?
At a water park! There may be nothing as fun as a water park on a hot day. Fun is one of the uses of water. What
are some others?

Water Consumption

Humans use six times as much water today as they did 100 years ago. People living in developed countries use a far
greater proportion of the world’s water than people in less developed countries. What do people use all of that water
for?

How We Use Water

The image below shows how people use water worldwide ( Figure 6.7). The greatest use is for agriculture and then
industry. Municipal use is last, but it is also important. Municipal use refers to water used by homes and businesses
in communities.

Agriculture

Many crops are grown where there isn’t enough rainfall for plants to thrive. For example, crops are grown in deserts
of the American Southwest. How is this possible? The answer is irrigation. Irrigation is any way of providing extra
water to plants. Most of the water used in agriculture is used for irrigation. Livestock also use water, but they use
much less.
Irrigation can waste a lot of water. The type of irrigation pictured below ( Figure 6.8) is the most wasteful. The
water is sprayed into the air and then falls to the ground. But much of the water never reaches the crops. Instead,
it evaporates in the air or runs off the ﬁelds. Irrigation water may cause other problems. The water may dissolve
agricultural chemicals such as pesticides. When the water soaks into the ground, the dissolved chemicals do too.
They may enter groundwater or run off into rivers or lakes. Salts in irrigation water can also collect in the soil. The
soil may get too salty for plants to grow.

6.4. Uses of Water

FIGURE 6.7
In this global water use chart, see how
much is used in agriculture. Why do you
think so much water is used in agricul-
ture?

FIGURE 6.8
Overhead irrigation systems like this one are widely used to irrigate crops
on big farms. What are some drawbacks of irrigation?

Industry

Almost a quarter of the water used worldwide is used in industry. Industries use water for many purposes. Chemical
processes need a lot of water. Water is used to generate electricity. An important way that industries use water is to
cool machines and power plants.

Household Uses

Think about all the ways people use water at home. Besides drinking it, they use it for cooking, bathing, washing
dishes, doing laundry, and ﬂushing toilets. The water used inside homes goes down the drain. From there it usually
ends up in a sewer system. At the sewage treatment plant, water is treated and prepared for reuse.
Households may also use water outdoors. If your family has a lawn or garden, you may water them with a hose or
sprinkler. You probably use water to wash the car ( Figure 6.9). Much of the water used outdoors evaporates or runs
off into the gutter. The runoff water may end up in storm sewers that ﬂow into a body of water, such as the ocean.

FIGURE 6.9
What will happen to the water that runs off the car? Where will it go?

Fun

Fun wasn’t on the pie chart ( Figure 6.7), but it’s important, too! There are many ways to use water for fun, from
white water rafting to snorkeling. When you do these activities, you don’t actually use water. You are doing the
activity on or in the water. What do you think is the single biggest use of water for fun? Believe it or not, it’s golf!
Keeping golf courses green uses an incredible amount of water. Since many golf courses are in sunny areas, much
of the water is irrigation water. Like any similar sprinkler system, much of this water is wasted. It evaporates or runs
off the ground.

FIGURE 6.10
Sunshine brings golfers to the desert, but
a lot of water is needed to make the
desert green enough to play.

Environment

It’s important to leave some water for the environment. In some places, water is used for wildlife habitat. Man-made
lakes create places for ﬁsh and water birds. Leaving water in the ecosystems keeps the environment good for many
species of plants and animals.

Summary

• People use water for agriculture, industry, and consumption.
• Water can also be used for fun and for the environment.
• Some water must remain in the environment to support ecosystems.

6.5 Water Distribution

• Describe how water is distributed across the globe.
• Explain the causes and consequences of too little water.

What do you have to do to get water?
In the developed world, we just open a tap. Clean water is available all the time. In many developing regions, women
have to walk long distances to get clean water. Sometimes there isn’t a source of clean water, and they just get what
they can ﬁnd. We take water for granted in the developed world.

Water Problems: Not Enough Water

Most Americans have plenty of fresh, clean water. But many people around the world do not. In fact, water scarcity
is the world’s most serious resource problem. How can that be? Water is almost everywhere. But much of it is
unusable. What is usable is not always where it is needed.

Where Is All the Water?

One problem is that only a tiny fraction of Earth’s water is fresh, liquid water that people can use. More than 97
percent of Earth’s water is salt water in the oceans. Just 3% is freshwater. Most of the freshwater is frozen in ice
sheets, icebergs, and glaciers ( Figure 6.11).

Rainfall and the Water Supply

Rainfall varies around the globe. About 40% of the land gets very little rain. About the same percentage of the
world’s people don’t have enough water. You can compare global rainfall with the worldwide freshwater supply at
the two URLs below. Drier climates generally have less water for people to use. In some places, people may have
less water available to them for an entire year than many Americans use in a single day! How much water is there
where you live?

FIGURE 6.11
This glacier in Alaska stores a lot of frozen
freshwater.

Wealth and the Water Supply

Richer nations can drill deep wells, build large dams, or supply people with water in other ways. In these countries,
just about everyone has access to clean running water in their homes, and water is cheap and easy to get. It’s no
surprise that people in these countries use the most water. In poorer nations, there is little money to develop water
supplies. Therefore, people get their water where they can.

Water Shortages

Water shortages are common in much of the world. People are most likely to run short of water during droughts. A
drought is a period of unusually low rainfall. Human actions have increased how often droughts occur. One way
people can help to bring on a drought is by cutting down trees. Trees add a lot of water vapor to the air. With fewer
trees, the air is drier and droughts are more common.
We already use six times as much water today as we did a hundred years ago. As the number of people rises, our
need for water will grow. By the year 2025, only half the world’s people will have enough clean water. Water is such
a vital resource that serious water shortages may cause other problems.

• Crops and livestock may die, so people will have less food available.
• Other uses of water, such as industry, may have to stop. This reduces the jobs people can get and the products

they can buy.

• People and nations may ﬁght over water resources.
• In extreme cases, people may die from lack of water.

The Figure 6.12 shows the global water situation in the 2030s with water stress and water scarcity on the map.

Summary

• Fresh water is not evenly distributed across the planet.
• Many of the world’s people live without access to enough clean water. That percentage is likely to increase as

populations grow.

• During a drought, life may become very hard for many people.

• Describe the causes and consequences of unsafe water.

What do you see in this photo?
The Ganges River is sacred to the people of India. It is also a major source of water for drinking and bathing for
millions of people. An estimated 400 million people are affected by pollution in the Ganges. What can be done to
protect a water body that has so much pressure placed on it?

Water Safety

The water Americans get from their faucets is safe. This water has been treated and puriﬁed. At least 20% of the
world’s people do not have clean drinking water always available. That’s more than 1 billion people. They must
drink water from where they can get it. Maybe straight from a river or pond ( Figure 6.13). Human wastes may
be in the water. If that’s the case, the water will probably contain pathogens. Pathogens are organisms that cause
diseases.

Waterborne Disease

Unsafe drinking water causes 88% of diseases worldwide. In many nations, these diseases are the leading cause of
death in children under the age of ﬁve. More than 14,000 people die every day from such diseases. Cholera is caused
by bacteria. A person gets guinea worm from drinking the guinea worm larvae ( Figure 6.14). The cholera bacteria
and guinea worms are pathogens.

6.7 Conserving Water

• Describe ways to conserve water.

Can you ﬁgure out how to do these things better?
The photos above are of water being wasted. Water being used for irrigation with much ﬂying into the air. A large
fountain in the desert. Excess water being used to wash a car. These sorts of waste occur all the time. How can these
activities be done without so much waste? How can irrigation or car washing use less water? What can people enjoy
in the desert that doesn’t involve so much water?

Conserving Water

Conserving water means using less of it. Of course, this mostly applies to people in the wealthy nations that have
the most water and also waste the most.

Saving Water in Irrigation

Irrigation is the single biggest use of water. Overhead irrigation wastes a lot of water. Drip irrigation ( Figure
6.15) wastes a lot less. Water pipes run over the surface of the ground. Tiny holes in the pipes are placed close to
each plant. Water slowly drips out of the holes and soaks into the soil around the plants. Very little of the water
evaporates or runs off the ground.

FIGURE 6.15
The above is a drip irrigation system. Look at the soil in the photo.
damp around each plant but dry everywhere else.

6.7. Conserving Water

Rationing Water

www.ck12.org

Some communities save water with rationing. Much rationing takes place only during times of drought. During
rationing, water may not be used for certain things. For example, communities may ban lawn watering and car
washing. People may be ﬁned if they use water in these ways. You can do your part. Follow any bans where you
live.

Saving Water at Home

It’s easy to save water at home. If you save even a few gallons a day you can make a big difference in the long run.
The best place to start saving water is in the bathroom. Toilet ﬂushing is the single biggest use of water in the home.
Showers and baths are the next biggest use. Follow the tips below to save water at home.

• Install water-saving toilets. They use only about half as much water per ﬂush. A single household can save up

to 20,000 gallons a year with this change alone!

• Remember what they say about bathroom ﬂushing in California during rationing: If it’s yellow, let it mellow;

if it’s brown, ﬂush it down!

• Take shorter showers. You can get just as clean in ﬁve minutes as you can in 10. And you’ll save up to 50

gallons of water each time you shower. That’s thousands of gallons each year.

• Use low-ﬂow shower heads. They use about half as much water as regular shower heads. They save thousands

of gallons of water.

• Fix leaky shower heads and faucets. All those drips really add up. At one drip per second, more than 6,000

gallons go down the drain in a year—per faucet!

• Don’t leave the water running while you brush your teeth. You could save as much as 10 gallons each time

you brush. That could add up to 7,000 gallons in a year.

• Landscape your home with plants that need little water. This could result in a huge savings in water use. Look

at the garden pictured below ( Figure 6.16); it shows that you don’t have to sacriﬁce beauty to save water.

FIGURE 6.16
This beautiful garden contains only plants that need very little water.

Summary

• Drip irrigation uses much less water than other methods.
• People can reduce water consumption by taking shorter showers, installing water-saving devices, and many

other methods.

• Communities sometimes ration water during times of drought.

A stream is a body of freshwater that ﬂows downhill in a channel. The channel of a stream has a bottom, or bed,
and sides called banks. Any size body of ﬂowing water can be called a stream. Usually, though, a large stream is
called a river.

Features of Streams and Rivers

All streams and rivers have several features in common ( Figure 6.18). The place where a stream or river starts is
its source. The source might be a spring, where water ﬂows out of the ground. Or the source might be water from
melting snow on a mountain top, like the stream pictured below ( Figure 6.17). A single stream may have multiple
sources.
A stream or river probably ends when it ﬂows into a body of water, such as a lake or an ocean. A stream ends at
its mouth. As the water ﬂows into the body of water, it slows down and drops the sediment it was carrying. The
sediment may build up to form a delta.
Several other features of streams and rivers are also shown above ( Figure 6.18).

FIGURE 6.17
A stream ﬂows fast and steep where it
originates in the mountains. This stream,
in Glacier National Park in Montana, is
coming from snow melt.

FIGURE 6.18
Water in a stream ﬂows along the ground
from higher to lower elevation. What force
causes the water to keep ﬂowing?

• Small streams often ﬂow into bigger streams or rivers. The small streams are called tributaries. A river and

all its tributaries make up a river system.

• At certain times of year, a stream or river may overﬂow its banks. The area of land that is ﬂooded is called the

ﬂoodplain. The ﬂoodplain may be very wide where the river ﬂows over a nearly ﬂat surface.

• A river ﬂowing over a ﬂoodplain may wear away broad curves. These curves are called meanders. Pictured

below is an example of this ( Figure 6.19).

River Basins and Divides

All of the land drained by a river system is called its basin, or watershed. One river system’s basin is separated from
another river system’s basin by a divide. The divide is created by the highest points between the two river basins.
Precipitation that falls within a river basin always ﬂows toward that river. Precipitation that falls on the other side of
the divide ﬂows toward a different river. A continental divide separates rivers that ﬂow into different oceans.
Pictured below are the major river basins in the U.S. ( Figure 6.20).

FIGURE 6.20
River basins in the U.S.

Summary

• A moving body of water of any size is a stream. A river is a large stream.
• A tributary begins at its headwaters on one side of a divide. Two tributaries come together at a conﬂuence.
• A river ends at an estuary. If the river drops sediment, it may create a delta.

6.9 Ponds and Lakes

• Describe the characteristics of ponds and lakes.

Why are lakes important?
Lakes are important habitats for lots of plants and animals. The slow motions of the water are easier for organisms
to live in than the water from rapidly moving streams. Some animals live on land but get at least part of their food
from lakes or ponds. This eagle is ﬁshing for its meal. What would happen if lakes dried up?

Ponds and Lakes

After a heavy rain, you may ﬁnd puddles of water standing in low spots. The same principle explains why water
collects in ponds and lakes. Water travels downhill, so a depression in the ground ﬁlls with standing water. A pond
is a small body of standing water. A lake is a large body of standing water. Most lakes have freshwater, but a few
are salty. The Great Salt Lake in Utah is an example of a saltwater lake.
The water in a large lake may be so deep that sunlight cannot penetrate all the way to the bottom. Without sunlight,
water plants and algae cannot live on the bottom of the lake. That’s because plants need sunlight for photosynthesis.

Water in Ponds and Lakes

Ponds and lakes may get their water from several sources. Some falls directly into them as precipitation. Some
enters as runoff and some from streams and rivers. Water leaves ponds and lakes through evaporation and also as
outﬂow.

398

www.ck12.org

How Lakes Form

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

The depression that allows water to collect to form a lake may come about in a variety of ways. The Great Lakes, for
example, are glacial lakes. A glacial lake forms when a glacier scrapes a large hole in the ground. When the glacier
melts, the water ﬁlls the hole and forms a lake. A kettle lake forms in the sediment left by a glacier when a block of
ice melts. Kettle lakes are found where continental glaciers once covered the land (Figure’ 6.21). Over time lakes
get water from rain, streams, and groundwater coming to the surface.

FIGURE 6.21
A moose in a kettle lake at Denali National Park in Alaska.

Other lakes are crater lakes or rift lakes ( Figure 6.22). Crater lakes form when volcanic eruptions create craters that
ﬁll with water. Rift lakes form when movements of tectonic plates create low places that ﬁll with water.

FIGURE 6.22
Craters and rifts become lakes when they
ﬁll with water. Where does the water
come from?

The Great Lakes

Large lakes are similar to oceans. They have tides and currents. Large lakes can affect weather patterns. The Great
Lakes ( Figure 6.23) contain 22% of the world’s fresh surface water. The largest of them, Lake Superior, has a tide
that rises and falls several centimeters each day. The Great Lakes cause “lake effect” snow. In the winter, a large
amount of snow may fall downwind of the relatively warm lakes. The Great Lakes are home to countless species of
ﬁsh and wildlife.

Reservoirs

Many lakes are not natural, but are human-made. People dam a stream in a suitable spot. Water backs up behind the
dam, creating a lake. These lakes are "reservoirs" ( Figure 6.24).

Summary

• Ponds are small water bodies often fed by springs.
• A lake or pond may form wherever water can collect. A lake basin could be a volcanic crater, where a glacier

has carved out a depression, or a fault zone.

• A reservoir is a man-made lake.

6.10 Flooding

• Explain the causes and effects of ﬂoods.
• Describe types of ﬂood protection.

Is the water cycle perfect?
The amount of water Earth has doesn’t change. So if the water cycle were perfect, there would always be the right
amount of water in each reservoir. In winter, there would be the right amount of snow. The snow would melt in the
right amounts and at the right times in the spring. A good amount of rain would fall. Not so little that there would be
a drought and not so much that there would be a ﬂood. But the water cycle is not perfect. Floods are all too common.

Floods

A ﬂood occurs when so much water enters a stream or river that it overﬂows its banks. Flood waters from a river are
pictured below ( Figure 6.25).
Floods are a natural part of the water cycle, but they can cause a lot of damage. Farms and homes may be lost, and
people may die. In 1939, millions of people died in a ﬂood in China. Although freshwater is needed to grow crops
and just to live, too much freshwater in the same place at once can be deadly.

Causes of Floods

Floods may occur when deep snow melts quickly in the spring. More often, ﬂoods are due to heavy rainfall. Floods
happen when rain falls more quickly than water can be absorbed into the ground or carried away by rivers or streams.
Extremely heavy rains across the Midwestern U.S. in April 2011 led to ﬂooding of the rivers in the Mississippi River
basin in May 2011 ( Figure 6.26 and Figure 6.27).

Flooding in Indiana.

FIGURE 6.26
This map shows the accumulated rainfall
across the U.S. in the days from April 22
to April 29, 2011.

Buffers to Flooding

Heavily vegetated lands are less likely to experience ﬂooding. Plants slow down water as it runs over the land, giving
it time to enter the ground. If the ground is too wet to absorb more water, plants still slow the water’s passage. Slower
water keeps all the water from entering the stream at once. Wetlands play a key role in minimizing the impacts of
ﬂoods. Wetlands act as a buffer between land and high water levels. Flooding is often more severe in areas that have
been recently logged.

Flood Protection

In dire situations, they use sandbags ( Figure 6.28). Dams
People protect areas that might ﬂood with dams.
are usually very effective, but high water levels sometimes cause a dam to break. In that case, ﬂooding can be
catastrophic. Flood waters can also overﬂow a dam. People may line a river bank with levees to protect against
ﬂoods. These are high walls that keep the stream within its banks during ﬂoods. Flood protection in one location
sometimes causes problems elsewhere. For example, a levee in one location may just force the high water upstream
or downstream. This will lead to ﬂooding in a different location. Sometimes water gets so high that the river must
be allowed to ﬂood.

meant to go. 2011 is the ﬁrst time since 1927 that this ﬂoodway was used.

FIGURE 6.28
Sandbags are put out to try to keep ﬂood-
waters from overtaking a town.

Effects of Floods

Amazingly, ﬂoods can be good. Flood waters carry nutrients that are deposited on the ﬂoodplain. So ﬂoodplains are
good places for farming. In the past, the Nile River ( Figure 6.29) in Egypt ﬂooded each year. The ﬂood waters
brought much-needed nutrients in to farms. In the 1960s Egypt built the Aswan Dam to protects crop and settlements
from the ﬂoods. However, after the dam was built, farmers began to need fertilizers to feed their crops.

6.11. Glaciers

www.ck12.org

6.11 Glaciers

• Describe the formation, movement, and characteristics of glaciers.

Can solid ice really move?
Yes! This is the Hubbard Glacier in Alaska. As the glacier meets the relatively warm seawater, it calves. Pieces of
the glacier break off and fall into the water. These icebergs may be as large as a ten-story building.

Where are the Glaciers?

Nearly all glacial ice is in the polar regions. The largest ice sheets are in Antarctica and Greenland. The remaining
1% of Earth’s ice is found elsewhere, like in the mountains, for example. At higher altitudes, temperatures are colder.
Snow is more likely to fall and not melt. Except Australia, every continent has glaciers in the high mountains.

Types of Glaciers

The types of glaciers are:

• Continental glaciers are large ice sheets that cover relatively ﬂat ground. These glaciers ﬂow outward from

where the greatest amounts of snow and ice accumulate.

• Alpine (valley) glaciers ﬂow downhill. Ice accumulates near the top of a mountain and then travels down

existing valleys ( Figure 6.30).

FIGURE 6.30
An alpine glacier in the Swiss Alps. Where do you think the word "alpine"
came from?

• Ice caps are large glaciers that cover a larger area than just a valley. An ice cap can bury an entire mountain

range or region ( Figure 6.31). Glaciers come off of ice caps into valleys.

406

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

FIGURE 6.31
The continent of Antarctica is covered with an ice cap.

Glacial Growth

Glaciers are not static; they grow, they move and they shrink. Currently, most glaciers are shrinking.

Formation

Glaciers grow when snowfall exceeds melting. Snow falls higher on the glacier. Over time, the snow converts to
granular ice known as ﬁrn. As more snow and ice collect, the ﬁrn becomes denser. This is now glacial ice.
Glaciers form only on land because water is too warm. When a glacier ﬂows into water, it usually breaks up into
icebergs. Those icebergs eventually melt into the water.

Movement

How does an ice ﬁeld become a glacier? In other words, why does the ice move? Whether an ice ﬁeld moves depends
on the amount of ice. It also depends on the steepness of the slope and the roughness of the ground surface. Ice
moves where the pressure is so great that the ice needs to move away. Ice also slides at the bottom. Often the ground
is lubricated by water that melted from the glacier above. Under some conditions, a glacier will move extremely
fast. Under other conditions, the glacier may not move and will become an ice sheet.
Because the ice is moving, glaciers have cracks called crevasses ( Figure 6.32). There is a large crevasse at the top
of an alpine glacier called a bergshrund. Below the bergshrund, the ice is moving downhill. Above the bergshrund,
the ice is stuck to the mountain.

Shrinking

Glaciers are melting back in many locations around the world. When a glacier no longer moves, it is called an ice
sheet. This usually happens when it is less than 0.1 km2 in area and 50 m thick.
In Glacier National Park ( Figure 6.33), many glaciers have become ice sheets. In 1850, the park had 150 glaciers.
There are only about 25 today. The reason that there is so much melting is that summer temperatures have risen.
Scientists estimate that the park will have no active glaciers as early as 2020.

Glaciers as a Resource

Melting glaciers in mountain regions provide an important source of water in the summer. Organisms and nearby
human populations may depend on glacial melt water during long dry summers. People near the Andes in South
America are just some of the groups that rely on glacial meltwater in the summer.

area. This makes it about one-ﬁfth the
size of the smallest active glaciers.

Summary

• Glaciers are ice that moves.
• Continental glaciers form in a central location with ice moving outward in all directions. Alpine glaciers form

in high mountains and travel through valleys. Ice caps cover large areas.

• Because glaciers move, they have characteristic features like crevasses and bergshrunds.

6.12 Introduction to Groundwater

• Deﬁne aquifer and explain how aquifers form and recharge.

What are these faucets tapping into?
This certainly is an odd sight! We expect to see water at Earth’s surface, but coming out of solid rock? Amazingly,
much of Earth’s fresh water is hidden from sight. It is present in rock and soil. In fact, 20 times more of Earth’s
liquid freshwater is found below the surface than on the surface.

410

www.ck12.org

Groundwater

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

Freshwater below Earth’s surface is called groundwater. The water inﬁltrates, or seeps down into, the ground from
the surface. How does this happen? And where does the water go?

Porous and Impermeable Rock

Water inﬁltrates the ground because soil and rock may have air spaces between the grains. These pores, or tiny holes,
result in the rock’s porosity. If water can move through a rock, the rock is permeable. Eventually, the water reaches
a layer of rock that is not porous. This rock is impermeable. Water stops moving downward when it reaches an
impermeable layer.
This animation shows porosity and permeability: http://www.nature.nps.gov/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/animate/POROS_-
3.MPG . The water droplets are found in the pores between the sediment grains. This is porosity. When the water
can travel between pores, that’s permeability.
The diagram below ( Figure 6.34) shows two layers of porous rock. The top layer is not saturated; it is not full of
water. The next layer is saturated. The water in this layer has nowhere else to go. It cannot seep any deeper into the
ground because the rock below it is impermeable.

FIGURE 6.34
Water seeps into the ground through per-
meable material. The water stops when
it reaches an impermeable rock. Predict
the purpose of the well in the diagram.

The Water Table

The top of the saturated rock layer above ( Figure 6.34) is called the water table. The water table isn’t like a real
table. It doesn’t remain ﬁrmly in one place. Instead, it rises or falls, depending on how much water seeps down from

411

6.12. Introduction to Groundwater

www.ck12.org

the surface. The water table is higher when there is a lot of rain, and it is lower when the weather is dry.

Summary

• Water inﬁltrates into the ground.
• There is much more fresh water underground than on the surface.
• A rock layer must be porous and permeable to be a good aquifer. An impermeable layer makes up the bottom

of an aquifer.

• The water table rises and falls with additions or subtractions to the groundwater system.

In some parts of the world, gathering water for the family is a process that takes several hours. This is usually
considered to be women’s work. What are you doing during the hours that girls your age might be helping their
mothers gather water?

Aquifer

An underground layer of rock that is saturated with groundwater is called an aquifer. A diagram of an aquifer is
pictured below ( Figure 6.35). Aquifers are generally found in porous rock, such as sandstone. Water inﬁltrates the
aquifer from the surface. The water that enters the aquifer is called recharge.

Human Use of Aquifers

Most land areas have aquifers beneath them. Many aquifers are used by people for fresh water. The closer to the
surface an aquifer is, the easier it is to get the water. However, an aquifer close to the surface is also more likely to
become polluted. Pollutants can seep down through porous rock in recharge water.
An aquifer that is used by people may not be recharged as quickly as its water is removed. The water table may
lower and the aquifer may even run dry. If this happens, the ground above the aquifer may sink. This is likely to
damage any homes or other structures built above the aquifer.

FIGURE 6.35
An aquifer is a layer of saturated porous
rock.
It lies below the water table. An
impermeable layer, such as clay, is below
the aquifer.

Wells

Most groundwater does not ﬂow out of an aquifer as a spring or geyser. So to use the water that’s stored in an aquifer,
people must go after it. How? They dig a well. A well ( Figure 6.36) is a hole that is dug or drilled through the
ground down to an aquifer.
People have depended on water from wells for thousands of years. To bring water to the surface takes energy because
the force of gravity must be overcome. Today, many wells use electricity to pump water to the surface. However,
in some places, water is still brought to the surface the old-fashioned way—with human labor. The well pictured
below ( Figure 6.37) is an example of this type of well. A hand-cranked pulley is used to lift the bucket of water to
the surface.

Summary

• An aquifer is a saturated layer of rock or soil.
• Most groundwater use is from wells.
• People use fresh water from aquifers from springs or wells.

6.14 Springs and Geysers

• Describe the features of an aquifer.
• Explain how springs are created.

A sacred spring
At Tampak Siring in Bali, Indonesia, spring water emerges into a temple. The water is thought to have healing
powers. Many Hindu people come to the temple to emerge in the water and pray. They hope the water will cure their
diseases.

Springs

The top of an aquifer may be high enough in some places to meet the surface of the ground. This often happens on
a slope. The water ﬂows out of the ground and creates a spring. A spring may be just a tiny trickle, or it may be a
big gush of water.
Water ﬂowing out of the ground at a spring may ﬂow downhill and enter a stream. If the water from a spring can’t
ﬂow downhill, it may spread out to form a pond or lake instead. In the desert, the only reliable water may be from
springs ( Figure 6.38). A spring may allow wildlife to inhabit an uninhabitable area.

Artesian Spring

Sometimes an aquifer is conﬁned. A conﬁned aquifer is trapped between two impermeable rock layers. Pressure
from the rock layer on top forces the water out where the aquifer reaches the ground surface. Water that ﬂows up to
the surface naturally is an artesian spring. If people drill a well into a conﬁned aquifer, the water may ﬂow to the
surface without assistance. This is an artesian well ( Figure 6.39).

Mineral Springs and Hot Springs

Some springs have water that contains minerals. Groundwater dissolves minerals out of the rock as it seeps through
the pores. The water in some springs is hot because it is heated by hot magma. Many hot springs are also mineral
springs. That’s because hot water can dissolve more minerals than cold water.
Springs in Yellowstone National Park are hot and contain dissolved minerals. Morning Glory Pool ( Figure 6.40)
has a bright green color from dissolved minerals. Along the edge are thick orange mats of bacteria. The bacteria use
the minerals in the hot water to make food.

FIGURE 6.40
Morning Glory Pool in Yellowstone National Park is a mineral spring.

Geysers

Heated groundwater may become trapped in spaces within rocks. Pressure builds up as more water seeps into the
spaces. When the pressure becomes great enough, the water bursts out of the ground at a crack or weak spot. This is
called a geyser. When the water erupts from the ground, the pressure is released. Then more water collects and the
pressure builds up again. This leads to another eruption.
Old Faithful ( Figure 6.41) is the best-known geyser in the world. The geyser erupts faithfully every 90 minutes,
day after day. During each eruption, it may release as much as 30,000 liters of water!

Summary

• Earth’s internal heat can create a hot spring.
• If hot water becomes trapped, pressure may build up. When the water breaks free, it creates a geyser.

6.15 Groundwater Depletion

• Explain the causes and consequences of groundwater depletion.

What makes the desert bloom? Water!
You hear a lot about making the desert bloom. Many plants do well in the desert if they are given water. Since
deserts do not have much water, groundwater is used. In many desert locations, groundwater is being pumped much
faster than it is being recharged. What will happen in the future?

Human Use of Aquifers

Most land areas have aquifers beneath them. Many aquifers are used by people for freshwater. The closer to the
surface an aquifer is, the easier it is to get the water. However, an aquifer close to the surface is also more likely to
become polluted. Pollutants can seep down through porous rock in recharge water.
People may use the water in an aquifer faster than it is recharged. When this happens, the water table will lower.
Wells may go dry. To get to the water, the well will need to be dug deeper.
As the water table lowers, the ground above the aquifer may sink. This is called subsidence. When the ground
subsides, any homes or other structures built above the aquifer will be damaged. The San Joaquin Valley of California
is one of the world’s major agricultural areas. So much groundwater has been pumped that the land has subsided
many tens of feet.

The Ogallala Aquifer

One of the biggest aquifers in the world is the Ogallala aquifer. As you can see below ( Figure 6.43), this aquifer
lies beneath parts of eight U.S. states. In some places, it is less than a meter deep. In other places, it is hundreds of
meters deep. The water in the aquifer is mostly from the last ice age.

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

FIGURE 6.42
The signs on the pole show where ground
level was at different years. The subsi-
dence is due to groundwater depletion.

The Ogallala aquifer is an important source of freshwater in the American Midwest. This is a major farming area,
and much of the water is used to irrigate crops. The water in this aquifer is being used up ten times faster than it is
recharged. If this continues, what might happen to the Ogallala aquifer?

Summary

• When water is pumped from an aquifer, the water table goes down. Wells must be drilled deeper to get water.
• The Ogallala Aquifer was ﬁlled in the ice age. It is heavily used to irrigate Midwestern farms. The use rate is

several times faster than the recharge rate.

• Ground subsidence is a consequences of groundwater overuse.

6.16 Water Pollution

• Describe the sources of water pollution.
• Describe the causes and consequences of unsafe water.

Do you live near water? Do you see pollution?
Water pollution is a worldwide problem. Almost anything released into the air or onto the land can end up in Earth’s
water.

423

6.16. Water Pollution

Surface Water Pollution

www.ck12.org

Water pollution may come from one source. For example, chemicals from a factory may empty into a stream. Water
pollution may come from more than one source, too. For example, chemicals may rain from the air into that same
stream. It is much more difﬁcult to control pollution from more than one source.
In the developed nations there are three main sources of water pollution:

1. Agriculture.
2. Industry.
3. Municipal, or community.

Agriculture

Chemicals that are applied to farm ﬁelds include fertilizers and pesticides. Excess chemicals can be picked up by
rainwater. The chemicals can end up in streams, ponds, lakes, or the ocean. Dissolved fertilizer causes tremendous
numbers of water plants and algae to grow. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes or the coastal
oceans.
Waste from livestock can also pollute water. The waste contains pathogens that can cause diseases. Many farms in
the U.S. have thousands of animals. These farms produce millions of gallons of waste. The waste is stored in huge
lagoons, like the one pictured below ( Figure 6.44). Many leaks from these lagoons have occurred.

FIGURE 6.44
This is a pond of hog manure. Check out
the vehicles at the bottom of the picture
for scale.

Industry

Factories and power plants may pollute water with harmful substances.

• Many industries produce toxic chemicals.
• Nuclear power plants produce radioactive wastes.
• Oil tanks and pipelines can leak.

424

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

FIGURE 6.45
Oil spills are hard to clean up and kill a lot of wildlife.

Municipal

“Municipal” refers to the community. Households and businesses in a community can pollute the water supply.
Municipal pollution comes from sewage, storm drains, septic tanks, boats, and runoff from yards. For example:

• People apply chemicals to their lawns. The excess can run off into surface waters.
• People may dispose of harmful substances incorrectly. For example, motor oil must not be drained into a

storm sewer.

• Municipal sewage treatment plants dump treated wastewater into rivers or lakes. But the wastewater may not

be treated for everything, or it may not be treated enough.

Summary

• Pollution enters water from municipal, industrial, agricultural sources.
• Fertilizer runoff can create dead zones in the ocean.
• People pollute water when they apply excess chemicals to their lawn. They may also dispose of pollutants

incorrectly.

6.17. Protecting Water From Pollution

www.ck12.org

6.17 Protecting Water From Pollution

• Explain how the water supply can be protected.

How could a river burn?
In the mid 1900s, rivers sometimes caught ﬁre. The Cuyahoga River did several times. The river was so full of oil
and industrial waste that it was ﬂammable. Nothing could live in it. A ﬁre on the Cuyahoga River in 1969 gained
national attention. Something had to be done to protect the water supply.

Protecting the Water Supply

The water supply can be harmed in two major ways. The water can be polluted, and it can be overused. Protecting
the water supply must address both problems. We need to reduce how much pollution ends up in the water
supply—keeping water from being polluted is easier and cheaper than cleaning it. We need to treat water that’s
already polluted. We need to conserve water by using less.

Controlling Water Pollution

Disasters, such as rivers burning, led to new U.S. laws to protect the water. For example, the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) was established, and the Clean Water Act was passed. Now, water is routinely tested.
Pollution is tracked to its source, and polluters are forced to ﬁx the problem and clean up the pollution. They are
also ﬁned. These consequences have led industries, agriculture, and communities to pollute the water much less than
before.

426

www.ck12.org

The Clean Water Act

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

Keeping water clean often requires laws. Laws ensure that people behave responsibly. The Clean Water Act regulates
water pollution in the U.S. The law allows the EPA to set standards for water quality. The EPA regulates the
pollutants that can enter waterways. The agency can provide money for wastewater treatment plants. The law was
passed in 1972.
International groups are trying to improve global water quality. The United Nations and other groups provide the
technology for treating water. They educate people in how to protect and improve their water ( Figure 6.46).

FIGURE 6.46
Scientists control water pollution by sampling the water and studying the
pollutants that are in the water.

Water Treatment

Water treatment is a series of processes that remove unwanted substances from water. The goal of water treatment
is to make the water safe to return to the natural environment or to the human water supply. Treating water for other
purposes may not include all the same steps. That’s because water used in agriculture or industry may not have to
be as clean as drinking water.
Below, you can see how water for drinking is treated ( Figure 6.47). Treating drinking water requires at least four
processes:

1. Chemicals are added to untreated water. They cause solids in the water to clump together. This is called

coagulation.

2. The water is moved to tanks. The clumped solids sink to the bottom of the water. This is called sedimentation.
3. The water is passed through ﬁlters that remove smaller particles from the water. This is called ﬁltration.
4. Chlorine is added to the water to kill bacteria and other microbes. This is called disinfection. Finally, the

water is pure enough to drink.

What Can You Do?

What can individuals do to protect water quality?

• Dispose of motor oil and household chemicals properly. Phone your community for instructions.
• Use lawn, garden, and farm chemicals sparingly. Use them wisely. Excess chemicals will run off into the

water supply.

• Repair automobile or boat engine leaks immediately.
• Keep litter, pet waste, leaves, and grass clippings out of street gutters and storm drains.

Summary

• There are multiple levels of water treatment. Some water is cleaned enough for use on lawns. Some must be

made safe for drinking.

• Individuals can protect water by following some guidelines.
• The Clean Water Act regulates pollutants and provides money for wastewater treatment plants to be built.
• Keeping water from becoming polluted is easier, less expensive, and safer than cleaning it once it is polluted.

6.18 Cleaning Up Groundwater

• Describe how groundwater is polluted.
• Understand why it is difﬁcult and expensive to clean groundwater.

Would you drink this water?
Cleaning water is not easy. Cleaning groundwater is especially difﬁcult. If you want to drink clean water, ground-
water must not become polluted. Or it must be cleaned.

Groundwater Pollution

Pollutants in surface water can ﬁlter into the ground and enter a groundwater aquifer. Irrigation water can bring
pesticides and other chemicals. Water can seep through landﬁlls. Tanks of gasoline stored underground can leak.
Pollutants can be ﬁltered out of water that travels through rock and soil. Filtering is very effective, but it doesn’t get
out all of the pollutants.
Pollutants that enter an aquifer spread outward from the source. They spread in the direction the water is moving.

430

www.ck12.org

Cleaning Groundwater

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

It is a lot easier and cheaper not to pollute surface water than it is to clean it. That is even truer for groundwater.
To clean groundwater, the water must be cleaned. Also, the rock and soil it travels through must be cleaned. Then
the toxic rock and soil must be put somewhere. Cleaning polluted groundwater is expensive and can take years.
Sometimes it can’t even be done.

Stages of Groundwater Cleaning

To clean groundwater you must:

• Eliminate the pollution source: An underground tank must be pumped dry and then dug out from the ground.
A factory must be required to stop releasing toxic chemicals. Farms must be more careful about the chemicals
they put on their ﬁelds.

• Monitor the extent of the pollutant: Scientists test water in wells. Sometimes they drill wells to test water.
They learn how the groundwater is ﬂowing: how fast and in what direction. They study the contaminants in
the groundwater. Then they determine where the contaminant plume is going.

FIGURE 6.48
Test wells are drilled to monitor groundwater pollution.

• Engage in remediation: A barrier is constructed in the aquifer. This isolates the contaminated groundwater
from the rest of the aquifer. The contaminated groundwater must be treated. Remediation is correcting a
problem.

– The cheapest and easiest way is to treat the water in the aquifer.

* Bioremediation is one way of treating the water in the aquifer. Microorganisms are bioengineered
to eat the pollutant. The organisms are injected into the contaminated region. They consume the
pollutant. Bioremediation is short for biological remediation.

* Chemical remediation can also treat water in the aquifer. A chemical is pumped into the aquifer.

The chemical destroys the contaminant.

– It is much more difﬁcult and expensive to remove the water from the aquifer and then treat it. The water
is pumped to the surface. It is then cleansed using chemical or biological methods. It is re-injected
into the aquifer. The contaminated rock and soil must be dug up and the pollutant destroyed. Then it is
returned to the ground. This is done only in extreme cases.

Summary

• To clean groundwater: remove the pollutant source, monitor the pollutant, and perform remediation.
• Scientists test the water in many wells to see where the contaminant is. They do this to tell where the

contaminant is. Over time they can tell which direction the contaminant is moving.

• Cleaning groundwater in an aquifer requires bioremediation or chemical remediation. Bioremediation uses

microorganisms to consume a pollutant. Chemical remediation destroys the contaminant.

6.19 Importance of the Oceans

• Describe the important effects of the oceans on Earth.

What does this whale know about the oceans?
People divide up the seas into ﬁve oceans. But they are really all interconnected. Even so, they are all very different.
This ocean is near a shore and is obviously in a cold region. It appears to be a good habitat for whales! No matter
what, the oceans have a huge inﬂuence on the planet, locally and as a whole.

The Oceans’ Inﬂuence

Oceans cover more than 70% of Earth’s surface. Oceans hold 97% of the planet’s surface water. It’s no surprise that
the oceans have a big inﬂuence on the planet. The oceans affect the atmosphere, climate, and living things.

Oceans and the Atmosphere

Oceans are the major source of water vapor in the atmosphere. Sunlight heats water near the sea surface ( Figure
6.49). As the water warms, some of it evaporates. The water vapor rises into the air, where it may form clouds and
precipitation. Precipitation provides the freshwater needed by plants and other living things.
Ocean water also absorbs gases from the atmosphere. The most important are oxygen and carbon dioxide. Oxygen
is needed by living things in the oceans. Much of the carbon dioxide sinks to the bottom of the seas. Carbon dioxide
is a major cause of global warming. By absorbing carbon dioxide, the oceans help control global warming. At least
as long as the carbon dioxide stays in the seas.

Oceans and Climate

Coastal areas have a milder climate than inland areas. They are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.
That’s because land near an ocean is inﬂuenced by the temperature of the oceans. The temperature of ocean water is
moderate and stable. Why? There are two major reasons:

433

6.19. Importance of the Oceans

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 6.49
The oceans and atmosphere exchange
gases. Why does water vapor enter the
atmosphere from the water?

1. Water is much slower to warm up and cool down than land. As a result, oceans never get as hot or as cold as

land.

2. Water ﬂows through all the world’s oceans. Warm water from the Equator mixes with cold water from the

poles. The mixing of warm and cold water makes the water temperature moderate.

Even inland temperatures are milder because of oceans. Without oceans, there would be much bigger temperature
swings all over Earth. Temperatures might plunge hundreds of degrees below freezing in the winter. In the summer,
lakes and seas might boil! Life as we know it could not exist on Earth without the oceans.

Oceans and Living Things

The oceans provide a home to many living things. In fact, a greater number of organisms lives in the oceans than on
land. Coral reefs ( Figure 6.50) have more diversity of life forms than almost anywhere else on Earth. Biological
diversity is shortened to biodiversity. Oceans contain the majority of biomass on Earth.

Summary

• Oceans are an important part of the water cycle. They absorb gases from the atmosphere. They evaporate and

supply water vapor to the atmosphere.

• Oceans moderate Earth’s temperature by not changing temperature rapidly. Oceans also distribute heat around

the planet.

• Oceans have tremendous biodiversity. They also contain the majority of all biomass on Earth.

www.ck12.org

6.20 Seawater Chemistry

• Describe the composition of seawater.
• Explain the relationship between the composition of seawater and its properties.

What do you get when you evaporate seawater?
Salt! Human bodies need salt to live. Nowadays most of this salt comes from the oceans or saline lakes. Some salt
comes from rocks that evaporated from seawater.

Makeup of Ocean Water

You know that ocean water is salty. How salty is it? What is the salinity of seawater? Average seawater is about
3.5% salt. The amount is different if there is a nearby source of freshwater. It is also different if there is a lot
of evaporation in an area. How do you think these things affect seawater salinity? Seawater also contains other
substances like sugars, acids, bases, and organic molecules.

Why Is Ocean Water Salty?

Ocean water is salty because water dissolves minerals out of rocks. The ions enter the water. This happens whenever
water ﬂows over or through rocks. Much of this water and its minerals end up in the oceans. Minerals dissolved in
water form salts. When the water evaporates, it leaves the salts behind. As a result, ocean water is much saltier than
other water on Earth.

How Salty Is Ocean Water?

Have you ever gone swimming in the ocean? If you have, then you probably tasted the salts in the water. By mass,
salts make up about 3.5% of ocean water. The table below shows the most common minerals in ocean water ( Table

436

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

6.1). The main components are sodium and chloride. Together they form the salt known as sodium chloride. You
may know the compound as table salt or the mineral halite.

The amount of salts in ocean water varies from place to place. For example, near the mouth of a river, ocean water
may be less salty. That’s because river water contains less salt than ocean water. Where the ocean is warm, the water
may be more salty. Can you explain why? (Hint: More water evaporates when the water is warm.)

Density

Seawater has lots of salts in it. This increases its density (mass per volume) over fresh water. Temperature and
pressure also affect density.
Water density increases as:

• salinity increases.
• temperature decreases.
• pressure increases.

Differences in water density are responsible for deep ocean currents, as will be discussed in the concept "Deep Ocean
Currents."

Summary

• Water moving through rock and soil picks up ions. Those ions end up as salts in large bodies of water.
• Ocean water contains salts and other substances.
• Water density increases as salinity and pressure increase, or as temperature decreases.

6.21 Ocean Zones

• Identify and describe the vertical and horizontal ocean zones.

If you go down in the ocean what do you see?
Imagine you’re in a submersible going to the bottom of the ocean. The ﬁrst thing you realize is that it’s not light for
very long. The next thing is that many of the creatures that live just below where it’s light create their own light.
This is called bioluminescence. What is the advantage of being able to light up if you live in the dark?

Ocean Zones

In addition to the amount of salts, other conditions in ocean water vary from place to place. One is the amount of
nutrients in the water. Another is the amount of sunlight that reaches the water. These conditions depend mainly on
two factors: distance from shore and depth of water. Oceans are divided into zones ( Figure 6.51) based on these
two factors. The ocean ﬂoor makes up another zone.

Zones Based on Distance from Shore

There are three main ocean zones based on distance from shore. They are the intertidal zone, neritic zone, and

into ocean water from land. Therefore, water closer to shore tends to have more nutrients. Living things need
nutrients. So distance from shore also inﬂuences how many organisms live in the water.

Zones Based on Depth of Water

Scientists refer to the vertical extent of ocean water as the water column. Two main zones based on depth of water
are the photic zone and aphotic zone. The photic zone is the top 200 meters of water. The aphotic zone is water
deeper than 200 meters. The deeper you go, the darker the water gets. That’s because sunlight cannot penetrate very
far under water. Sunlight is needed for photosynthesis. So the depth of water determines whether photosynthesis is
possible. There is enough sunlight for photosynthesis only in the photic zone.
Water also gets colder as you go deeper. The weight of the water pressing down from above increases as well. At
great depths, life becomes very difﬁcult. The pressure is so great that only specially adapted creatures can live there.

Summary

• The small surface zone that has light is the photic zone. The entire rest of the ocean does not have light and is

the aphotic zone.

• The ocean is divided into horizontal zones based on the depth of water beneath: the intertidal, neritic, and

oceanic.

• Most of the life forms in the oceans live in, or at least visit, the surface.

6.22 Wind Waves

• Describe the characteristics of ocean waves.
• Explain how wind forms ocean waves.

Surﬁn’ U.S.A.
Jaws Beach in Maui, Hawaii has legendary waves. The largest waves come when winds are very strong, usually in
the winter. The rocks and reef offshore magnify the size of the incoming wave energy. Cowabunga!

Waves

Most ocean waves are caused by winds. A wave is the transfer of energy through matter. A wave that travels across
miles of ocean is traveling energy, not water. Ocean waves transfer energy from wind to the water. The energy is
transferred from one water molecule to the next. The energy of a wave may travel for thousands of miles. The water
itself moves very little. The picture below shows how water molecules move when a wave goes by ( Figure 6.52).
Once the wave starts, it doesn’t need more wind to keep it going.

An animation of a shallow water wave is seen here: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Shallow_water_wav
e.gif .

The Size of Waves

The ﬁgure above also shows how the size of waves is measured ( Figure 6.52). The highest point of a wave is the
crest. The lowest point is the trough. The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the wave height. Wave

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

FIGURE 6.52
A wave travels through the water. How
would you describe the movement of wa-
ter molecules as a wave passes through?

height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and
wavelength are measures of wave size.
The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater
each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is
a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over
long distances and may last for many days.

Breaking Waves

The ﬁgure below shows what happens to waves near shore ( Figure 6.53). As waves move into shallow water, they
start to touch the bottom. The base of the waves drag and slow. Soon the waves slow down and pile up. They get
steeper and unstable as the top moves faster than the base. When they reach the shore, the waves topple over and
break.

FIGURE 6.53
Waves break when they reach the shore.

6.22. Wind Waves

Storm Surge

www.ck12.org

Some of the damage done by storms is from storm surge. Low pressure in a storm pulls water upward. Water piles
up at a shoreline as storm winds push waves into the coast. Storm surge may raise sea level as much as 7.5 m (25
ft). This can be devastating in a shallow land area when winds, waves, and rain are intense.
A wild video of “Storm Surge” can be seen on National Geographic Videos, Environment Video, Natural Disasters,
Landslides, and more: http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/player/environment/ .
Maverick waves are massive. Learning how they are generated can tell scientists a great deal about how the ocean
creates waves and especially large waves.

Summary

• The largest wind waves are built when a strong wind blows for a long time over a large area.
• It is not the water that travels in a wave; it is the energy that is transferred from where the wave formed.
• A wave breaks when it is too tall to be supported by its base. This is common as a wave moves up the shore.

6.23. Tides

www.ck12.org

6.23 Tides

• Describe types of tides.
• Explain what causes tides.

Did you ever build a sandcastle?
A sandcastle only lasts until the next tide comes in. To build a sand castle the sand must be moist enough for the
grains to stick together. So it has to be near the water. But that puts the castle in position to be buried by the next
high tide. Oh well. You can build another one when the tide goes back out!

Tides

Tides are daily changes in the level of ocean water. They occur all around the globe. High tides occur when the
water reaches its highest level in a day. Low tides occur when the water reaches its lowest level in a day. Tides keep
cycling from high to low and back again. In most places the water level rises and falls twice a day. So there are two
high tides and two low tides approximately every 24 hours.
Below, you can see the difference between high and low tides ( Figure 6.54). This is called the tidal range.

Why Tides Occur

The ﬁgure below shows why tides occur ( Figure 6.55). The main cause of tides is the pull of the Moon’s gravity on
Earth. The pull is greatest on whatever is closest to the Moon. Although the gravity pulls the land, only the water
can move. As a result:

• Water on the side of Earth facing the Moon is pulled hardest by the Moon’s gravity. This causes a bulge of

water on that side of Earth. That bulge is a high tide.

446

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

FIGURE 6.54
Where is the intertidal zone in this pic-
ture?

• Earth itself is pulled harder by the Moon’s gravity than is the ocean on the side of Earth opposite the Moon.

As a result, there is bulge of water on the opposite side of Earth. This creates another high tide.

• With water bulging on two sides of Earth, there’s less water left in between. This creates low tides on the other

two sides of the planet.

FIGURE 6.55
High and low tides are due mainly to the
pull of the Moon’s gravity.

Spring Tides and Neap Tides

The Sun’s gravity also pulls on Earth and its oceans. The Sun is much larger than the Moon, so is its pull greater
than the Moon’s? The pull of the Sun’s gravity is much less because the Sun is much farther away. The Sun’s gravity
strengthens or weakens the Moon’s inﬂuence on tides.
The ﬁgure below shows where the Moon is relative to the Sun at different times during the month ( Figure 6.56).
The positions of the Moon and Sun relative to each other affects the tides. This creates spring tides or neap tides.

• Spring tides occur during the new moon and full moon. The Sun and Moon must either be in a straight line
on the same side of Earth, or they must be on opposite sides of Earth. Their gravitational pull combines to
cause very high and very low tides. Spring tides have the greatest tidal range.

• Neap tides occur during the ﬁrst and third quarters of the Moon. The Moon and Sun are at right angles to each
other. Their gravity pulls on the oceans in different directions so the highs and lows are not as great. Neap
tides have the smallest tidal range.

6.24 Surface Ocean Currents

• Deﬁne major and local surface currents.
• Explain how major and local surface currents are created.

What can debris tell us about surface currents?
The surface of the ocean is on the move. One way to see this is when something is dumped in the ocean. Where will
it end up? The tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011 pulled a lot of material into the ocean. The image above is a
model created in April 2012. The orange and red are where ﬂoating debris might be. Scientists are creating models
of where the debris will go. But no one knows for sure where it will go or when it will get there.

Surface Currents

Like air in the atmosphere, ocean water moves in currents. A current is a stream of moving water that ﬂows through
the ocean. Surface currents are caused mainly by winds but not daily winds. Surface currents are caused by the
major wind belts. These winds blow in the same direction all the time. So they can keep water moving in the same
direction.
Surface currents are created by three things:

• global wind patterns
• the rotation of the Earth
• the shape of the ocean basins

Surface currents are extremely important because they distribute heat around the planet. Surface currents also have
a tremendous inﬂuence on climate around the globe.

450

www.ck12.org

Global Wind Patterns

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

Winds on Earth are either global or local. Global winds blow in the same directions all the time. They are created
when more solar energy strikes the Equator than the polar regions. More about global wind patterns is described in
detail in the concept "Global Wind Belts."
The major wind belts push the water in the surface currents. The water moves in the direction of :

• trade winds: east to west between the Equator and 30°N and 30°S.
• westerlies: west to east in the middle latitudes.
• polar easterlies: east to west between 50° and 60° north and south of the Equator and the North and South

Poles.

Earth’s Rotation

The rotation of the Earth—that is, the Coriolis effect—causes the ocean currents to turn. More information about
the phenomenon can be found in the concept "Coriolis Effect."

Shape of the Ocean Basins

A surface current move across the ocean. Eventually, the current runs into land ( Figure 6.57). When it does, it turns
right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere. The direction is due to Coriolis effect.

The major surface currents are pictured below ( Figure 6.58). They ﬂow in a clockwise direction in the Northern
Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, they ﬂow in the opposite direction. These loops are called gyres. Only
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current ﬂows nonstop around the globe.

terns shown here.

Local Surface Currents

Currents are also found along shorelines ( Figure 6.59). They are not related to the global wind belts. Two are
longshore currents and rip currents.
Rip currents are very dangerous currents! Rip currents move large amounts of water offshore quickly. Look at the
rip-current animation to determine what to do if you are caught in a rip current: http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/oc
ean/motion/currents2.htm . Each summer in the United States, at least a few people die when they are caught in rip
currents.

southeastern United States: http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/ofs/viewer.shtml?-gulfmex-cur-0-large-rundate=latest .

www.ck12.org

6.25 How Ocean Currents Moderate Climate

• Describe how surface ocean currents moderate climate.
• Explain how the Gulf Stream alters climate in the British Isles.

How do ocean currents create giant redwoods?
The California Current brings cool water south along the western United States. Cool water contacting warmer water
creates fog. This creates a favorable habitat for the giant redwoods of the northern California coast.

Surface Currents and Climate

Large ocean currents can have a big impact on climate, especially of nearby coasts. The Equator and the poles have
very different climates today. But these regions woud be much more different without ocean surface currents. These
currents move heat around the globe. The best known of these is the Gulf Stream, which warms parts of Europe.
But other currents also alter near-shore climates. Like the Gulf Stream, the Kushiro Current warms Japan. Cooler
currents that move from the polar regions to the Equator also alter climate.

The Gulf Stream

The Gulf Stream carries warm water from near the Equator up the eastern coast of North America. Look at the map
below ( Figure 6.60); it shows how the Gulf Stream warms both the water and land along the coast.
The warm water then ﬂows across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. The Gulf Stream’s warm waters raise temperatures
in the North Sea. The warmer ocean temperatures raise the air temperatures over land. The difference is between 3
to 6°C (5 to 11°F). London, U.K., for example, is about six degrees farther south than Quebec, Canada. However,
London’s average January temperature is nearly 16°C (28°F) warmer. London also gets a lot of rain ( Figure 6.61).
Air traveling over the warm Gulf Stream water picks up moisture. Quebec is much drier but much snowier ( Figure
6.62).

Summary

• Water in the Gulf Stream warms as it travels along the Equator. The Gulf Stream brings warm water north

along the United States. It then travels across the northern Atlantic to the British Isles.

• The Gulf Stream creates a relatively warm wet climate for the British Isles. This compares with the frigid

Quebec at about the same latitude.

• Ocean currents transfer heat from the Equator toward the poles. This moderates Earth’s temperature.

6.26 Deep Ocean Currents

• Describe the processes that drive deep ocean currents.

Why do small ﬁsh live in upwelling zones?
Seawater is always on the move. Water that comes up to the surface from deep is rich with nutrients. Plankton gather
where nutrients are plentiful. Small ﬁsh come to eat the plankton. Of course, larger ﬁsh and birds come to eat the
smaller ﬁsh. So upwelling is responsible for an abundance of life.

Deep Currents

Currents also ﬂow deep below the surface of the ocean. Deep currents are caused by differences in density at the
top and bottom. More dense water takes up less space than less dense water. It has the same mass but less volume.
Water that is more dense sinks. Less dense water rises. What can make water more dense?

Downwelling

Water becomes more dense when it is colder and when it has more salt. In the North Atlantic Ocean, cold winds chill
the water at the surface. Sea ice grows in this cold water, but ice is created from fresh water. The salt is left behind
in the seawater. This cold, salty water is very dense, so it sinks to the bottom of the North Atlantic. Downwelling
can take place in other places where surface water becomes very dense ( Figure 6.63).
When water sinks it pushes deep water along at the bottom of the ocean. This water circulates through all of the
ocean basins in deep currents.

457

6.26. Deep Ocean Currents

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 6.63
Deep currents ﬂow because of differences
in density of ocean water.

Upwelling

Sometimes deep ocean water rises to the surface. This is called upwelling. The ﬁgure below shows why it happens
( Figure 6.64). Strong winds blow surface water away from shore. This allows deeper water to ﬂow to the surface
and take its place.

FIGURE 6.64
An upwelling occurs when deep ocean
water rises to the surface.

When water comes up from the deep, it brings a lot of nutrients with it. Why is deep water so full of nutrients? Over
time, dead organisms and other organic matter settle to the bottom water and collect. The nutrient-rich water that
comes to the surface by upwelling supports many living things.
An animation of upwelling is seen here: http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/currents/03coastal4.html .
Upwelling also takes place along the Equator. Winds blow the surface water north and south. This leaves a void that

458

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

deep water can upwell into. The nutrients rise to the surface and support a great deal of life in the equatorial oceans.

Summary

• Cooling or evaporation of fresh water from the sea surface makes surface water dense. This causes the surface

water to undergo downwelling.

• Downwelling of cold, dense water pushes deep water along. This drives thermohaline circulation.
• Upwelling takes place at some coastlines or along the Equator. Upwelling brings cool, nutrient-rich water to

the surface.

6.27 Coastal Pollution

• Explain where ocean pollution comes from.
• Describe where ocean pollutants go.

When is trash in the oceans good?
Well, not good exactly, but useful. In 1992 a ship lost 28,000 plastic bath toys in the North Paciﬁc. Oceanographers
sent out word and people alerted them when they found the toys on beaches. The oceanographers used these ﬁndings
to map ocean currents.

Ocean Water Pollution

The oceans are vast. You might think they are too big to be harmed by pollution. But that’s not the case. Ocean
water is becoming seriously polluted. This pollution affects the coasts. It even affects the seas far from shore.

Coastal Pollution

The oceans are most polluted along coasts. Why do you think that’s the case? Of course, it’s because most pollution
enters the oceans from the land. Runoff and rivers carry the majority of pollution into the ocean. Many cities dump
their wastewater, water mixed with waste, directly into coastal waters. In some parts of the world, raw sewage and

460

www.ck12.org

Chapter 6. Water on Earth

trash may be thrown into the water ( Figure 6.65). Coastal water may become so polluted that people get sick if they
swim in it or eat seafood from it. The polluted water may also kill ﬁsh and other ocean life.

FIGURE 6.65
This coastal ocean water is full of trash and sewage.

Much of the trash in the oceans is plastic. Many types of plastic do not degrade. Some break down into plastic
molecules, but these can also be a pollutant. Plastic shopping bags are extremely abundant in the oceans. Since
water runs from land into the sea, chemicals can end up in the sea. Pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers are among
the chemicals.

Open Water Pollution

Most of the trash that is in the oceans comes from the land. About 20% comes from ships. Trash is thrown overboard
by many vessels. Fishing boats throw over lines and nets.
There is a very large patch of garbage known as the Great Paciﬁc Garbage Patch. Trash from the lands all around
the North Paciﬁc gets caught up in currents. The currents bring the trash into the center of the North Paciﬁc Gyre.
The concentration of trash increases toward the center of the gyre.
While recognizable pieces of garbage are visible, much of the trash is tiny plastic molecules. The molecules are
invisible but are seen in water samples. Plastic confetti-like pieces are also found in the gyre.
The size of the garbage patch is unknown, since it can’t be seen from above. Some people estimate that it’s twice
the size of continental U.S, with a mass of 100 million tons.

Effect on Organisms

Animals can be harmed or killed by trash in the oceans. Seabirds and mammals may sometimes accidentally eat
plastic bags. This may kill the animals. Fishing nets can entangle ﬁsh and other animals so that they cannot
escape. Plastic molecules are ingested by organisms. Some that ﬁlter water for nutrients may take in a lot of plastic
molecules. They may eventually die. Larger ﬁsh or humans eat them and may take in the plastics too. Some of the
plastics may absorb harmful chemicals.

Reducing Ocean Pollution

Everyone can help to keep trash from entering the ocean. Reduce your use of plastics, especially plastic bags.
Dispose of trash and chemicals properly. Be sure that coastal communities dispose of trash safely. If you’re on a
ship, do not dump trash overboard in sensitive locations. Be sure that ships obey laws that protect the seas.

Summary

• Most ocean pollution comes from land and most is found near the coasts. Most of this trash is plastic.
• Plastic trash does not usually biodegrade in the ocean. It breaks down into tiny plastic molecules.
• Ocean pollutants are harmful to marine organisms.

6.28 Oil Spills

• Explain how oil spills can take place.
• Describe how they can be cleaned up.

Can you see the oil in a big oil spill?
Of course. The photo on the left shows the Gulf of Mexico oil spill after oil has leaked for nearly one month. About
a month later, about twice as much oil had spilled into the Gulf, as seen on the left. The water moves and so the oil
moves with it.

Oil Spills

Oil spills are another source of ocean pollution. To get at oil buried beneath the seaﬂoor, oil rigs are built in the
oceans. These rigs pump oil from beneath the ocean ﬂoor. Huge ocean tankers carry oil around the world.
If
something goes wrong with a rig on a tanker, millions of barrels of oil may end up in the water. The oil may coat
and kill ocean animals. Some of the oil will wash ashore. This oil may destroy coastal wetlands and ruin beaches.

The Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill

The ﬁgure below shows workers trying to clean up oil on a Louisiana beach ( Figure 6.67). The oil washed ashore
after a deadly oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

FIGURE 6.67
After an oil rig explosion, hundreds of miles of beaches looked like this
one. Cleaning them up was a huge task.

New drilling techniques allow oil companies to drill in deeper waters than ever before. In April 2010 a rig in the Gulf
of Mexico exploded. Eleven workers were killed and 17 injured. When the drill rig sank, a pipe was disconnected

463

6.28. Oil Spills

www.ck12.org

and oil gushed into the Gulf. Three months later the well was capped. But 4.9 million barrels had entered the Gulf,
about 16 times more oil than the largest oil spill to date.

Cleanup

Once the oil is in the water, there are three ways to try to clean it:

1. Removal: Corral and then burn the oil.
2. Containment: Use containment booms to trap the oil.
3. Dispersal: Use chemicals to get the oil to disperse, called chemical dispersants. Some scientists think that

the harm to the environment from the dispersants is as great as the harm from the oil.

The total effect of the oil spill on the environment of the Gulf is not yet known. Oil is found in the sediments on the
seaﬂoor. Many people who ﬁsh or are involved in Gulf tourism were also impacted. Studies of the effects of the oil
spill on people and animals will continue for many years.

What You Can Do

Small amounts of oil leak into the oceans from wells or ships. By reducing the amount of oil and gas you use, you
decrease the need for these commodities. Also, be sure to dispose of motor oil correctly. Motor oil poured down a
sewage grate can end up in the sea. It’s important to be sure that companies follow environmental regulations. They
must also be cautious when they drill or transport oil in the oceans. People can demand that companies protect the
ocean environment.

Summary

• Most ocean pollution comes from land and most is found near the coasts. Most of this trash is plastic.
• Plastic trash does not usually biodegrade in the ocean but just forms tiny plastic molecules.
• Massive amounts of oil that have been spilled into a water body can be removed, contained, or dispersed. This

is not easy or complete.

Summary

Water is found on Earth as a gas, liquid and solid. Water as a gas is mostly in the atmosphere. Water as a solid is
found as ice ﬂoating on ponds, as frost on a car, or in glaciers, among other places. Glaciers move, by deﬁnition,
although they do it very slowly. Liquid water moves around the planet through streams, groundwater, lakes, ponds.
Most of Earth’s liquid water is in the oceans. But it doesn’t remain stagnant there. Seawater moves in waves, tides,
and currents. Some ocean water changes state and becomes sea ice. Water may evaporate into the atmosphere and
become water vapor. Water sets Earth apart from the other planets in the solar system. In fact, water in all three
states is probably exceedingly rare everywhere in the galaxy. Human activities pollute water. Pollutants come from
industrial, municipal and agricultural sources. Water is protected from pollution by acts and rules that guide people
to protect water. Water can also be cleaned up once it is polluted.

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

Introduction

How can Earth’s atmosphere be in constant motion?
Stand outside on a windy day and it’s easy to see that Earth is a dynamic planet. But being dynamic requires energy.
Where does that energy come from? In the atmosphere, it comes from the Sun. Solar energy provides the power
needed for the atmosphere to move.

469

7.1. Importance of the Atmosphere

www.ck12.org

7.1 Importance of the Atmosphere

• Deﬁne the atmosphere.
• Describe the roles the atmosphere plays on Earth.

Why is the Atmosphere Important?
Why is Earth the only planet in the solar system known to have life? The main reason is Earth’s atmosphere.
Organisms need the gases in the atmosphere to live. Water is also essential for life. Water vapor is one of the gases
in the atmosphere. Green algae, like in this photo, are primitive life.

The Atmosphere

The atmosphere is a mixture of gases that surrounds the planet. We also call it air. The gases in the atmosphere
include nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Along with water vapor, the atmosphere allows life to survive.
Without it, Earth would be a harsh, barren world.

Why the Atmosphere Is Important

We are lucky to have an atmosphere on Earth. The atmosphere supports life and is also needed for the water cycle
and weather. The gases of the atmosphere even allow us to hear.

The Atmosphere and Living Things

Most of the atmosphere is nitrogen, but it doesn’t do much. Carbon dioxide and oxygen are the gases in the
atmosphere that are needed for life.

470

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

• Plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. They use sunlight to change carbon dioxide and water into

food. The process releases oxygen. Without photosynthesis, there would be very little oxygen in the air.

• Other living things depend on plants for food. These organisms need the oxygen plants release to get energy

out of the food. Even plants need oxygen for this purpose.

The Atmosphere and the Sun’s Rays

The atmosphere protects living things from the Sun’s most harmful rays. Gases reﬂect or absorb the strongest rays
of sunlight ( Figure 7.1).

FIGURE 7.1
The atmosphere shields Earth from the most harmful solar rays.

The Atmosphere and Earth’s Temperature

Gases in the atmosphere surround Earth like a blanket. They keep the temperature in a range that can support life.
The gases keep out some of the Sun’s scorching heat during the day. At night, they hold the heat close to the surface,
so it doesn’t radiate out into space.

The Atmosphere and Earth’s Water

The image below shows the role of the atmosphere in the water cycle ( Figure 7.2). Water vapor rises from Earth’s
surface into the atmosphere. As it rises, it cools. The water vapor may then condense into water droplets and form
clouds. If enough water droplets collect in clouds, they may come together to form droplets. The droplets will fall
as rain. This how freshwater gets from the atmosphere back to Earth’s surface.

The Atmosphere and Weather

Without the atmosphere, there would be no clouds or rain. In fact, there would be no weather at all. Most weather
occurs because the atmosphere heats up more in some places than others.

The Atmosphere and Weathering

Weather makes life interesting. Weather also causes weathering. Weathering is the slow wearing down of rocks on
Earth’s surface. Wind-blown sand scours rocks like sandpaper. Glaciers of ice scrape across rock surfaces like a ﬁle.
Even gentle rain may seep into rocks and slowly dissolve them. If the water freezes, it expands. This eventually
causes the rocks to crack. Without the atmosphere, none of this weathering would happen. Rocks at the surface
would be pristine and unaltered.

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 7.2
The atmosphere is a big part of the water
cycle. What do you think would happen to
Earth’s water without it?

The Atmosphere and Sound

Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves. Sound waves cannot travel through empty space, but they can travel
through gases. Gases in the air allow us to hear most of the sounds in our world. Because of air, you can hear birds
singing, horns tooting, and friends laughing. Without the atmosphere, the world would be a silent, eerie place.

Summary

• The atmosphere is made of gases that are essential for photosynthesis and other life activities.
• The atmosphere is a crucial part of the water cycle. It is an important reservoir for water, and the source of

precipitation.

• The atmosphere moderates Earth’s temperature. Weather takes place in the atmosphere.
• Without air, Earth would be silent.

7.2. Composition of the Atmosphere

www.ck12.org

7.2 Composition of the Atmosphere

• Describe the composition of the atmosphere.

Just what is air?
Air is easy to forget about. We usually can’t see it, taste it, or smell it. We can only feel it when it moves. But air is
actually made of molecules of many different gases. It also contains tiny particles of solid matter.

Gases in Air

The ﬁgure below shows the main gases in air ( Figure 7.3). Nitrogen and oxygen make up 99% of air. Argon and
carbon dioxide make up much of the rest. These percentages are the same just about everywhere in the atmosphere.
Air also includes water vapor. The amount of water vapor varies from place to place. That’s why water vapor isn’t
included in the ﬁgure above. It can make up as much as 4% of the air.

Water Vapor

Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. Humidity varies from place to place. It also varies in the same
place from season to season. On a summer day in Atlanta, Georgia, humidity is high. The air feels very heavy and
sticky. On a winter day in Flagstaff, Arizona, humidity is low. The air sucks moisture out of your nose and lips.
Humidity can change rapidly if a storm comes in. Humidity can vary over a short distance, like near a lake. Even
when humidity is at its highest, water vapor makes up only about 4% of the atmosphere.

474

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

FIGURE 7.3
This graph identiﬁes the most common
gases in air.

Greenhouse Gases

Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. This is essential so that Earth has a more moderate temperature.
Without greenhouse gases, nighttime temperatures would be frigid. Natural greenhouse gases include carbon
dioxide, methane, water vapor, and ozone. CFCs and some other man-made compounds are also greenhouse gases.
Human activities may increase the amount of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere.

Particles in the Air

Air includes many tiny particles. The particulates may consist of dust, soil, salt, smoke, or ash. Some particulates
pollute the air and may make it unhealthy to breathe. But having particles in the air is very important. Tiny particles
are needed for water vapor to condense on. Without particles, water vapor could not condense. Then clouds could
not form, and Earth would have no rain.

Summary

• The major atmospheric gases are nitrogen and oxygen. The atmosphere also contains minor amounts of other

gases, including carbon dioxide.

• Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. These gases include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and

ozone.

• Not everything in the atmosphere is gas. Particulates are particles that are important as the nucleus of raindrops

and snowﬂakes.

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

7.3 Pressure and Density of the Atmosphere

• Deﬁne air density and air pressure.
• Explain how they change with increasing altitude.

Have your ears ever popped?
If your ears have ever "popped," you have experienced a change in air pressure. Ears "pop" because the air pressure
is different on the inside and the outside of your ears.

Properties of Air

We usually can’t sense the air around us unless it is moving. But air has the same basic properties as other matter.
For example, air has mass, volume, and, of course, density.

Density of Air

Density is mass per unit volume. Density is a measure of how closely molecules are packed together. The closer
together they are, the greater the density. Since air is a gas, the molecules can pack tightly or spread out.

477

7.3. Pressure and Density of the Atmosphere

www.ck12.org

The density of air varies from place to place. Air density depends on several factors. One is temperature. Like other
materials, warm air is less dense than cool air. Since warmer molecules have more energy, they are more active. The
molecules bounce off each other and spread apart. Another factor that affects the density of air is altitude.

Altitude and Density

Altitude is height above sea level. The density of air decreases with height. There are two reasons: at higher
altitudes, there is less air pushing down from above, and gravity is weaker farther from Earth’s center. So at higher
altitudes, air molecules can spread out more, and air density decreases ( Figure 7.4).

FIGURE 7.4
This drawing represents a column of air. The column rises from sea level
to the top of the atmosphere. Where does air have the greatest density?

Air Pressure

Because air is a gas, its molecules have a lot of energy. Air molecules move a lot and bump into things. For this
reason, they exert pressure. Air pressure is deﬁned as the weight of the air pressing against a given area.
At sea level, the atmosphere presses down with a force of about 1 kilogram per square centimeter (14.76 pounds per
square inch). If you are standing at sea level, you have more than a ton of air pressing against you. Why doesn’t the
pressure crush you? Air presses in all directions at once. Other molecules of air are pushing back.

Altitude and Air Pressure

Like density, the pressure of the air decreases with altitude. There is less air pressing down from above the higher
up you go. Look at the bottle pictured below ( Figure 7.5). It was drained by a hiker at the top of a mountain. Then
the hiker screwed the cap on the bottle and carried it down to sea level. At the lower altitude, air pressure crushed it.
Can you explain why?

Summary

• Air density and pressure decrease with increasing altitude.
• Ears pop as air pressures inside and outside of the ear equalize.
• Gravity pulls more air molecules toward the center of the planet.

7.4 Temperature of the Atmosphere

• Deﬁne temperature gradient.
• Explain how air temperature creates the layers of the atmosphere.

Did you know that you can see the layers of the atmosphere?
The layers of the atmosphere appear as different colors in this image from the International Space Station. Imagine
looking out the window at a view like that!

Air Temperature

The atmosphere has layers. The layers correspond with how temperature changes with altitude. By understanding
the way temperature changes with altitude, we can learn a lot about how the atmosphere works.

Warm Air Rises

This is really important: Warm air rises. Why does warm air rise ( Figure 7.6)? Gas molecules are able to move
freely. Gas molecules move more at higher temperatures. They can take up as much space as is available.

• When gas molecules are cool, they are sluggish. They take up less space. With the same number of molecules

in less space, both air density and air pressure are higher.

• When gas molecules are warm, they move vigorously. They take up more space. Air density and air pressure

are lower.

Warmer, lighter air is more buoyant than the cooler air above it. So the warm air rises. The cooler air is denser than
the air beneath it. So it sinks down. This is convection: warm air rises, and cool air sinks. Warm ﬂuids can undergo
convection as well. This is described in the chapter Plate Tectonics.

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

FIGURE 7.6
Papers held up by rising air currents above a radiator demonstrate the
important principle that warm air rises.

Temperature Gradient

Air temperature changes with altitude. This does not occur in the same way as pressure and density, which decrease
with altitude. Changes in air temperature are not regular. A change in temperature with distance is called a
temperature gradient.

Temperature of the Atmosphere

Air temperature changes as altitude increases. In some layers of the atmosphere, the temperature decreases. In other
layers, it increases ( Figure 7.7). Refer to this ﬁgure as you read about the layers in the coming concepts.

Summary

• Warm air rises, cool air sinks. Warm air has lower density.
• Different layers of the atmosphere have different temperature gradients.
• Temperature gradient is the change in temperature with distance.

7.5 Troposphere

• Describe the characteristics and importance of the troposphere.
• Explain temperature inversion.

What if we took a ﬁeld trip to the troposphere?
A ﬁeld trip to the troposphere could start below sea level in Badwater Basin in Death Valley. It could end at the top
of Mt. Everest at 29,029 feet (8,848m). In other words, every human activity that’s in air is in the troposphere. You
might say that your life is a ﬁeld trip to the troposphere!

Troposphere

The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. All of the air you breathe is in the troposphere. All of Earth’s
weather—wind, rain, snow, heat—is in the troposphere. The troposphere is the lowest and most important layer of
the atmosphere!

Properties of the Troposphere

The troposphere is the shortest layer of the atmosphere. It rises to only about 12 kilometers (7 miles) above the
surface. Even so, this layer holds 75% of all the gas molecules in the atmosphere. That’s because the air is densest
in this layer.
In the troposphere, temperature decreases with altitude. The troposphere gets some of its heat directly from the Sun.
Most, however, comes from Earth’s surface. The surface is heated by the Sun. Some of that heat radiates back into
the air. This makes the temperature higher near the surface than at higher altitudes.

Mixing of Air

Air in the troposphere is warmer closer to Earth’s surface. Warm air is less dense than cool air, so it rises higher in
the troposphere. This starts a convection cell. Convection mixes the air in the troposphere. Rising air is also a main
cause of weather. All of Earth’s weather takes place in the troposphere.

483

7.5. Troposphere

Temperature Inversion

www.ck12.org

Sometimes air doesn’t mix in the troposphere. This happens when air is cooler close to the ground than it is above.
The cool air is dense, so it stays near the ground. This is called a temperature inversion ( Figure 7.8). An inversion
can trap air pollution near the surface. Temperature inversions are more common in the winter. Can you explain
why?

FIGURE 7.8
Temperature Inversion and Air Pollution.
How does a temperature inversion affect
air quality?

Tropopause

At the top of the troposphere is a thin layer of air called the tropopause. This layer acts as a barrier. It prevents cool
air in the troposphere from mixing with warm air in the stratosphere.

Summary

• In the troposphere, warm air ordinarily sits below cooler air.
• With a temperature inversion, cold air sits below warm air. This traps the cold air because it cannot rise into

the warm air.

• An inversion starts over land at night or in the winter, or near the coast.

7.6 Stratosphere

• Describe the stratosphere and the ozone layer within it.
• Explain the ozone layer’s importance to life on Earth.

Can we take a ﬁeld trip to the stratosphere?
Sure we can! If you’ve ever ﬂown on a jet airplane, you’ve been in the stratosphere. Airplanes ﬂy in the stratosphere,
because there is less friction. They get better gas mileage and so costs are lower. There is also less turbulence, so
passengers are happier. Can you identify the bottom of the stratosphere in the photo? It’s where the clouds begin.
Remember that all weather is in the troposphere.

Stratosphere

The stratosphere is the layer above the troposphere. The layer rises to about 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the
surface.

Temperature in the Stratosphere

Air temperature in the stratosphere increases with altitude. Why? The stratosphere gets most of its heat from the
Sun. Therefore, it’s warmer closer to the Sun. The air at the bottom of the stratosphere is cold. The cold air is dense,
so it doesn’t rise. As a result, there is little mixing of air in this layer.

The Ozone Layer

The previous section said that the troposphere is the most important layer of the atmosphere. But it’s not the only
important layer. The stratosphere contains a layer of ozone gas. Ozone consists of three oxygen atoms (O3). The
ozone layer is in the stratosphere. Ozone in the layer absorbs high-energy ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV radiation
splits the ozone molecule ( Figure 7.9). The split creates an oxygen molecule (O2) and an oxygen atom (O). This
split releases heat that warms the stratosphere. By absorbing UV radiation, ozone also protects Earth’s surface. UV
radiation would harm living things without the ozone layer.

and the mesosphere.

Summary

• There is little mixing between the troposphere and the stratosphere.
• Ozone gas protects life on Earth from harmful UV light.
• The ozone layer is in the stratosphere. It has a higher concentration of ozone than the rest of the atmosphere.

7.7 Mesosphere

• Describe the mesosphere.
• Describe the phenomena that appear in the mesosphere.

Next up: A ﬁeld trip to the mesosophere!
Not so fast. The mesosphere is the least known layer of the atmosphere. The mesosphere lies above the highest
altitude an airplane can go. It lies below the lowest altitude a spacecraft can orbit. Maybe that’s just as well. If
you were in the mesosphere without a space suit, your blood would boil! This is because the pressure is so low that
liquids would boil at normal body temperature.

Mesosphere

The mesosphere is the layer above the stratosphere. It rises to about 85 kilometers (53 miles) above the surface.
Temperature decreases with altitude in this layer.

Temperature in the Mesosphere

There are very few gas molecules in the mesosphere. This means that there is little matter to absorb the Sun’s rays
and heat the air. Most of the heat that enters the mesosphere comes from the stratosphere below. That’s why the
mesosphere is warmest at the bottom.

489

7.7. Mesosphere

Meteors in the Mesosphere

www.ck12.org

Did you ever see a meteor shower ( Figure 7.10)? Meteors burn as they fall through the mesosphere. The space
rocks experience friction with the gas molecules. The friction makes the meteors get very hot. Many meteors burn
up completely in the mesosphere.

FIGURE 7.10
The Perseid meteor shower with the Milky
Way.

Red Sprites and Blue Jets

Red sprites and blue jets are electrical discharges ( Figure 7.11). They are not the same thing as lightning. They more
closely resemble the discharges seen in ﬂuorescent tubes. These events occur much higher up in the atmosphere than
lightning.

sphere than blue jets, while both occur

Polar Mesospheric Clouds

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

Clouds in the mesosphere are very rare. The ones that exist occur near the poles. The clouds are called polar
mesospheric clouds. At the edge of these clouds are noctilucent clouds ( Figure 7.12). They are forming more
often now, perhaps as a result of climate change.

FIGURE 7.12
Noctilucent clouds are the highest clouds
in the atmosphere.

Mesopause

At the top of the mesosphere is the mesopause. Temperatures here are colder than anywhere else in the atmosphere.
They are as low as -100° C (-212° F)! Nowhere on Earth’s surface is it that cold.

Summary

• The mesosphere has a very low density of gas molecules.
• Temperature decreases in the mesosphere with altitude. This is because the heat source is the stratosphere.
• The mesosphere has red sprites, blue jets, and two types of clouds.
• The mesosphere is no place for human life!

7.8 Thermosphere and Beyond

• Describe the characteristics of the thermosphere.
• Explain how aurora form.

Can you take a ﬁeld trip to the thermosphere? Maybe some day!
The inhabitants of the International Space Station and other space stations live in the thermosphere. They are not
directly in the thermosphere, of course. They must be inside the station or inside a space suit at all times. Maybe
some day you will join them!

Thermosphere

The thermosphere is the layer above the mesosphere. It rises to 600 kilometers (372 miles) above the surface. The
International Space Station and other space stations orbit Earth in this layer.

Temperature in the Thermosphere

Temperature increases with altitude in the thermosphere. Surprisingly, it may be higher than 1000° C (1800° F) near
the top of this layer! The Sun’s energy there is very strong. The molecules absorb the Sun’s energy and are heated
up. But there are so few gas molecules that the air still feels very cold. Molecules in the thermosphere gain or lose
electrons. They then become charged particles called ions.

Magnetosphere

Earth’s magnetosphere is controlled by the magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetosphere protects the planet from the solar
wind. The solar wind is ions that ﬂy from the Sun to Earth very fast. The magnetosphere protects Earth’s ozone
layer. So life on Earth needs the protection of the magnetosphere.

Have you ever seen a brilliant light show in the night sky? Sometimes the ions in the thermosphere glow at night.
Storms on the Sun energize the ions and make them light up. In the Northern Hemisphere, the lights are called the
northern lights, or aurora borealis. In the Southern Hemisphere, they are called southern lights, or aurora australis.
They are referred to together as the aurora ( Figure 7.13 and Figure 7.14).

Exosphere

The exosphere is the layer above the thermosphere. This is the top of the atmosphere. The exosphere has no real
upper limit; it just gradually merges with outer space. Gas molecules are very far apart in this layer, but they are
really hot. Earth’s gravity is so weak in the exosphere that gas molecules sometimes just ﬂoat off into space.

Summary

• The solar wind is made of high speed particles from the Sun. The magnetosphere protects Earth from the solar

wind.

• Particles from the Sun energize ions in the thermosphere. This creates the northern and southern lights.
• Gas molecules are exceedingly rare in the exosphere.

7.9 Electromagnetic Energy in the Atmosphere

• Identify types of energy.

Where can you ﬁnd energy?
Picture yourself sitting by the campﬁre. You and your family are using the ﬁre to stay warm on a chilly evening. As
the Sun goes down, the air gets colder. You move closer to the ﬁre. Heat from the ﬁre warms you. Light from the
ﬁre allows you to see your relatives. Maybe you put marshmallows on a stick and roast them. Yum.

What Is Energy?

What explains all of these events? The answer can be summed up in one word: energy. Energy is deﬁned as the
ability to do work. Doing anything takes energy. A campﬁre obviously has energy. You can feel its heat and see its
light. You can use its energy to cook food.

496

www.ck12.org

Forms of Energy

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

Heat and light from the campﬁre are forms of energy. There are many other forms of energy. Here are a few that are
important in Earth science:

• chemical energy: Energy that is let off after a chemical reaction.
• luminous energy: Also called light.
• nuclear energy: Energy that is let off when the atom of a nucleus is split.
• radiant energy: Energy of electromagnetic radiation. This is the topic of the concept "Solar Energy on Earth."
• sound energy: Energy from sound waves.
• thermal energy: Also called heat.

Conservation of Energy

Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can change form. For example, a piece of wood has chemical energy
stored in its molecules. When the wood burns, the chemical energy changes to heat energy and light energy.
Lightning converts electric potential energy into three kinds of energy. They are light energy, sound energy, and
thermal energy.
You convert food energy to movement ( Figure 7.15). That’s another way energy is transferred from one form to
another!

FIGURE 7.15
If the girl eats this apple it will provide the energy needed for her to run.

Movement of Energy

Energy can move from one place to another. It can travel through space or matter. That’s why you can feel the heat
of a campﬁre and see its light. These forms of energy travel from the campﬁre to you.

Summary

• Energy is the ability to do work.
• Energy cannot be created or destroyed. Energy can only change forms.
• Energy can change from one type to more than one type. For example, electric potential energy before a

lightning strike can turn into light, sound, and heat.

7.10 Solar Energy on Earth

• Describe how solar energy moves.
• Describe the different wavelengths of solar energy.

Just how important is this star?
Almost all energy at Earth’s surface comes from the Sun. The Sun’s energy heats the planet and the air around it.
This causes the atmosphere to move and create weather. Sunlight also powers photosynthesis and life on Earth.

The Sun’s Energy

Most of the energy at Earth’s surface comes from the Sun. Solar energy travels in tiny packets that move in waves.
The waves have different wavelengths. Waves with different wavelengths carry different amounts of energy.

Photons of Energy

The Sun gives off energy in tiny packets called photons. Photons travel in waves. These waves make up electro-
magnetic radiation. The image below models a wave of light ( Figure 7.16). Notice the wavelength in the ﬁgure.
Waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy.

Electromagnetic Spectrum

Energy from the Sun has a wide range of wavelengths. The total range of energy is called the electromagnetic
spectrum ( Figure 7.17).

this ﬁgure, how would you deﬁne wave-
length?

FIGURE 7.17
Compare the wavelengths of radio waves
and gamma rays. Which type of wave has
more energy?

Visible light is the only light that humans can see. Different wavelengths of visible light appear as different
colors. Radio waves have the longest wavelengths. They also have the least amount of energy. Infrared light
has wavelengths too long for humans to see, but we can feel them as heat. The atmosphere absorbs the infrared light.
Ultraviolet (UV) light is in wavelengths too short for humans to see. The most energetic UV light is harmful to life.
The atmosphere absorbs most of this UV light from the Sun. Gamma rays have the highest energy, and they are the
most damaging rays. Fortunately, gamma rays don’t penetrate Earth’s atmosphere.

Summary

• Ultraviolet radiation has the highest energy; infrared the lowest.
• Solar energy travels in photons. Photons travel in waves, which make up electromagnetic radiation.
• Visible light is the wavelengths of light humans can see.

• Explain how radiation, conduction and convection work in the atmosphere.

Can you see energy moving?
It’s hard to see energy moving. But energy is the reason that air moves, and it is sometimes possible to see that. In
this photo, differences in temperature are causing air to move—in fantastic ways!

How Energy Moves Through the Atmosphere

Energy travels through space or material. Heat energy is transferred in three ways: radiation, conduction, and
convection.

Radiation

Radiation is the transfer of energy by waves. Energy can travel as electromagnetic waves through air or empty
space. The Sun’s energy travels through space by radiation. After sunlight heats the planet’s surface, some heat
radiates back into the atmosphere.

Conduction

In conduction, heat is transferred from molecule to molecule by contact. Warmer molecules vibrate faster than
cooler ones. They bump into the cooler molecules. When they do, they transfer some of their energy. Conduction
happens mainly in the lower atmosphere. Can you explain why?

Convection

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

Convection is the transfer of heat by a current. Convection happens in a liquid or a gas. Air near the ground is
warmed by heat radiating from Earth’s surface. The warm air is less dense, so it rises. As it rises, it cools. The
cool air is dense, so it sinks to the surface. This creates a convection current ( Figure 7.18). Convection is the most
important way that heat travels in the atmosphere.

FIGURE 7.18
Convection currents are the main way that heat moves through the
atmosphere. Why does warm air rise?

Summary

• In conduction, heat moves from areas of more heat to areas of less heat. The substances must be in direct

contact.

• In convection, materials move depending on their heat relative to nearby materials.
• In radiation, energy moves by waves.

7.12 Solar Energy and Latitude

• Describe the different amounts of solar energy that strike at different latitudes.

This is Antarctica. What season is this?
The Sun is always up, even in the middle of the night. That’s the photo on the left. In the day, the Sun never gets too
high in the sky. That’s the photo on the right. So, this is summer. In the winter, it’s just dark in Antarctica.

Energy and Latitude

Different parts of Earth’s surface receive different amounts of sunlight ( Figure 7.19). The Sun’s rays strike Earth’s
surface most directly at the Equator. This focuses the rays on a small area. Near the poles, the Sun’s rays strike the
surface at a slant. This spreads the rays over a wide area. The more focused the rays are, the more energy an area
receives, and the warmer it is.

FIGURE 7.19
The lowest latitudes get the most energy
from the Sun. The highest latitudes get
the least.

The difference in solar energy received at different latitudes drives atmospheric circulation. Places that get more
solar energy have more heat. Places that get less solar energy have less heat. Warm air rise, and cool air sinks. These
principles mean that air moves around the planet. The heat moves around the globe in certain ways. This determines
the way the atmosphere moves.

Summary

• A lot of the solar energy that reaches Earth hits the Equator.

7.13 Greenhouse Effect

• Describe the greenhouse effect.
• Explain how human actions contribute to the greenhouse effect.

How does the atmosphere resemble a greenhouse?
Farmers use greenhouses to extend the growing season. A greenhouse traps heat. Days that are too cool for a
growing plant can be made to be just right. Similar to a greenhouse, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere keep Earth
warm.

The Greenhouse Effect

When sunlight heats Earth’s surface, some of the heat radiates back into the atmosphere. Some of this heat is
absorbed by gases in the atmosphere. This is the greenhouse effect, and it helps to keep Earth warm. The greenhouse
effect allows Earth to have temperatures that can support life.
Gases that absorb heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases. They include carbon dioxide and water vapor.
Human actions have increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere ( Figure 7.20). The added gases
have caused a greater greenhouse effect. How do you think this affects Earth’s temperature?

FIGURE 7.20
Human actions have increased the natu-
ral greenhouse effect.

507

7.13. Greenhouse Effect

www.ck12.org

Like a blanket on a sleeping person, greenhouse gases act as insulation for the planet. The warming of the atmosphere
is because of insulation by greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases are the component of the atmosphere that moderate
Earth’s temperatures.

Greenhouse Gases

Greenhouse gases include CO2, H2O, methane, O3, nitrous oxides (NO and NO2), and chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs).
All are a normal part of the atmosphere except CFCs. The table below shows how each greenhouse gas naturally
enters the atmosphere ( Table 7.1).

Respiration, volcanic eruptions, decomposition of plant
material; burning of fossil fuels
Decomposition of plant material under some condi-
tions, biochemical reactions in stomachs
Produced by bacteria
Atmospheric processes
Not naturally occurring; made by humans

Different greenhouse gases have different abilities to trap heat. For example, one methane molecule traps 23 times
as much heat as one CO2 molecule. One CFC-12 molecule (a type of CFC) traps 10,600 times as much heat as one
CO2. Still, CO2 is a very important greenhouse gas, because it is much more abundant in the atmosphere.

Summary

• Greenhouse gases include CO2, H2O, methane, O3, nitrous oxides (NO and NO2), and chloroﬂuorocarbons

(CFCs).

• Greenhouse gases trap heat in the troposphere. Some greenhouse gases can trap more heat than others.
• Levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increasing due to human activities.

7.14 Circulation in the Atmosphere

• Explain why atmospheric circulation occurs.

Where can you go to experience wind?
Wind is one of the most obviously dynamic features of our dynamic planet. For a long time Mt. Washington in New
Hampshire was known as the windiest place on Earth. It no longer is called that, but it’s still plenty windy. A wind
speed of 231 miles per hour was recorded on the mountain in April 1934. In a 200 mph wind, you would not be able
to stand up. Temperatures due to wind chill would be outrageously cold!

Atmospheric Circulation

Wind is just moving air. You can’t really see it. Whether it’s a gentle breeze or strong wind, you are most aware
of air when it moves ( Figure 7.21). You can feel its molecules press against you. You can see things, like dirt and
leaves, moving in the wind. And you can see object moving, like ﬂags and trees, as a result of the wind.

Why Air Moves

Air movement takes place in the troposphere. This is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Air moves because of
differences in heating. These differences create convection currents and winds ( Figure 7.22).

• Air in the troposphere is warmer near the ground. The warm air rises because it is light. The light, rising air

creates an area of low air pressure at the surface.

510

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

FIGURE 7.21
How can you tell the wind is blowing in these photos?

• The rising air cools as it reaches the top of the troposphere. The air gets denser, so it sinks to the surface. The

sinking, heavy air creates an area of high air pressure near the ground.

• Air always ﬂows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Air ﬂowing over Earth’s surface

is called wind. The greater the difference in pressure, the stronger the wind blows.

FIGURE 7.22
Differences in air temperature cause con-
vection currents and wind.

Summary

• Warm air rises because it is less dense. This creates an area of low pressure.
• Cool air sinks because it is denser. This creates an area of high pressure.
• Wind blows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.

7.15 Local Winds

• Describe the types of local winds and how they are created.
• Explain how local winds inﬂuence a region’s environment.

Which large rainstorms are crucial for people in some parts of the world?
India, Pakistan, and other nations in southern Asia are great places to go to see monsoon rains. The region depends
on the water they bring. Parts of the Southwestern United States also receive monsoon rains. These rains break the
summer heat. They also provide water to desert plants. With winter rains and summer rains, these deserts are more
lush than many.

Local Winds

Local winds are winds that blow over a limited area. Local winds blow between small low and high pressure systems.
They are inﬂuenced by local geography. Nearness to an ocean, lake, or mountain range can affect local winds. Some
examples are found below. Local winds can affect the weather and climate of a region.

Land and Sea Breezes

Ocean water is slower to warm up and cool down than land. So the sea surface is cooler than the land in the daytime.
It is also cooler than the land in the summer. The opposite is also true. The water stays warmer than the land during
the night and the winter. These differences in heating cause local winds known as land and sea breezes ( Figure
7.23).

• A sea breeze blows from sea to land during the day or in summer. That’s when air over the land is warmer

than air over the water. The warm air rises. Cool air from over the water ﬂows in to take its place.

• A land breeze blows from land to sea during the night or in winter. That’s when air over the water is warmer

than air over the land. The warm air rises. Cool air from the land ﬂows out to take its place.

Monsoons

Monsoons are like land and sea breezes, but on a larger scale. They occur because of seasonal changes in the
temperature of land and water. In the winter, they blow from land to water. In the summer, they blow from water
to land. In regions that experience monsoons, the seawater offshore is extremely warm. The hot air absorbs a lot

of the moisture and carries it over the land. Summer monsoons bring heavy rains on land. Monsoons occur in
several places around the globe. The most important monsoon in the world is in southern Asia ( Figure 7.24). These
monsoons are important because they carry water to the many people who live there.

FIGURE 7.24
Monsoons blow over southern Asia.

514

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

Mountain and Valley Breezes

The air on a mountain slope warms more than the air over the nearby valley. The warm air rises and brings cool air
up from below. This is a valley breeze. At night the mountain slope cools more than the air over the valley. The air
ﬂows downhill creating a mountain breeze.

Katabatic Winds

Katabatic winds move the same way as mountain and valley breezes. However, they are much stronger. Katabatic
winds form over a high plateau that is surrounded by mountains. In winter, the plateau grows cold. Air sinks through
the gaps in the mountains. Over Antarctica and Greenland, these winds are frigid.

Chinook Winds

Chinook winds ( Figure 7.25) occur when air is forced over a mountain range. Warm air rises over the Sierra
Nevada in California, for example, because it is pushed eastward by the westerly winds. The air cools as it rises and
precipitates. The air is now dry. It sinks down the far side of the mountains and may create strong winds. These
Chinook winds are relatively warm. If there is snow, the winds may melt it quickly. The dry sinking air creates a
rainshadow effect. Rainshadow effect is responsible for many of the world’s deserts.

FIGURE 7.25
As air rises over a mountain it cools
and loses moisture. The air warms by
compression on the leeward side. The
resulting warm and dry winds are Chinook
winds. The leeward side of the mountain
experiences rainshadow effect.

Santa Ana Winds

Santa Ana winds ( Figure 7.26) are responsible for many large ﬁres in Southern California ( Figure 7.27). The
Santa Ana winds arrive at the end of California’s long summer drought season. Air east of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains cools in late fall. This creates a high pressure zone. The air is then forced downhill through the deserts
of the Southwest. It blows westward toward the ocean. The air is blocked by the San Gabriel and San Bernardino
Mountains. So it is funneled rapidly through the mountain passes. If a ﬁre starts, it spreads quickly. The result is
large-scale devastation.

Desert Winds

High summer temperatures on the desert create high winds and monsoon storms. Strong winds in the desert can pick
up dust and blow it around. A dust storm known as a haboob ( Figure 7.28) forms in the downdrafts on the front of

7.16 Global Wind Belts

• Explain how global winds form.
• Explain how global winds inﬂuence climate.

How did the "trade winds" get their name?
Not so long ago ships could only sail in the direction the wind was blowing, more-or-less. For centuries, a trip could
be made or broken by how hard the wind blew. The trade winds were named because they were a reliable way to get
across the ocean. Ships engaged in trade needed these winds to take or leave goods. The trade winds are one of the
global wind belts.

Global Winds

Global winds are winds that occur in belts that go all around the planet ( Figure 7.29). Like local winds, global
winds are caused by unequal heating of the atmosphere.

518

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

FIGURE 7.29
Global winds occur in belts around the
globe.

Heating and Global Winds

Earth is hottest at the Equator and gets cooler toward the poles. The differences in heating create huge convection
currents in the troposphere. At the Equator, for example, warm air rises up to the tropopause. When it can’t rise any
higher, it ﬂows north or south.
By the time the moving air reaches 30°N or °S latitude, it has cooled somewhat. The cool air sinks to the surface.
Then it ﬂows over the surface back to the Equator. Other global winds occur in much the same way. There are three
enormous convection cells north of the Equator and three south of the Equator.

Global Winds and the Coriolis Effect

Earth is spinning as air moves over its surface. This causes the Coriolis effect. Winds blow on a diagonal over the
surface due to Coriolis effect. From which direction do the northern trade winds blow?
Without the Coriolis effect the global winds would blow north to south or south to north. But the Coriolis effect
makes them blow northeast to southwest or the reverse in the Northern Hemisphere. The winds blow northwest to
southeast or the reverse in the Southern Hemisphere.
The wind belts have names. The Trade Winds are nearest the Equator. The next belt is the westerlies. Finally are the
polar easterlies. The names are the same in both hemispheres.

Jet Streams

Jet streams are fast-moving air currents high in the troposphere. They are also the result of unequal heating of the
atmosphere. Jet streams circle the planet, mainly from west to east. The strongest jet streams are the polar jets.
PIctured below is the northern polar jet ( Figure 7.30).

Summary

• Global winds blow from high to low pressure at the base of the atmospheric circulation cells.
• The globe has six atmospheric circulation cells. Three are north of the Equator and three are south. These

cells have names.

• Jet streams are fast moving rivers of air going in opposite directions.

7.17 Types of Air Pollution

• Distinguish between primary and secondary pollutants.
• Learn the sources of pollutants.

What is a pollution advisory?
Urban areas in sunny locations have pollution advisories. This happens when ozone levels get high. On these days,
you should stay indoors or exercise early or late in the day. Drive less and avoid ﬁlling your tank.

Air Pollutants

There are two main types of air pollutants: primary and secondary. Most air pollutants come from burning fossil
fuels. Some come from burning forests. Some are due to the evaporation of chemicals.

Types of Air Pollutants

There are two basic types of pollutants in the air. They are known as primary pollutants and secondary pollutants.

• Primary pollutants enter the air directly. Some are released by natural processes, like ash from volcanoes.

Most are released by human activities.

– Carbon oxides are released when fossil fuels burn.
– Nitrogen oxides form when nitrogen and oxygen combine at high temperatures. This occurs in hot

exhausts from vehicles, factories, and power plants.

– Sulfur oxides are produced when sulfur and oxygen combine. This happens when coal that contains

sulfur burns.

521

7.17. Types of Air Pollution

www.ck12.org

– Toxic heavy metals include mercury and lead. Mercury comes from smokestacks. Both metals have

industrial uses.

– Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are carbon compounds, such as methane. VOCs are released by

many human activities. Raising livestock, for example, produces a lot of methane.

– Particulates are solid particles. These particles may be ash, dust, or even animal wastes. Many are

released when fossil fuels burn.

• Secondary pollutants form from primary pollutants. Many occur as part of photochemical smog. This
type of smog is seen as a brown haze in the air. Photochemical smog forms when certain pollutants have a
chemical reaction in the presence of sunlight. Photochemical smog consists mainly of ozone (O3). Ozone near
the ground is a pollutant ( Figure 7.31). This ozone is harmful to humans and other living things. However,
ozone in the stratosphere protects Earth from the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

FIGURE 7.31
Ozone forms near the ground as a sec-
ondary pollutant.

Sources of Air Pollutants

Most pollutants enter the air when fossil fuels burn. Some are released when forests burn. Others evaporate into the
air.

Burning Fossil Fuels

Burning fossil fuels releases many pollutants into the air. These pollutants include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.

• Motor vehicles account for almost half of fossil fuel use.

522

www.ck12.org

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

• Power plants and factories account for more than a quarter of fossil fuel use ( Figure 7.32).
• Homes and other buildings burn fossil fuels.

FIGURE 7.32
Smoke stacks release a lot of pollutants into the air.

Burning Forests

Millions of acres of forest have been cut and burned to make way for farming ( Figure 7.33). Burning trees produces
most of the same pollutants as burning fossil fuels.

FIGURE 7.33
Cutting and burning trees to clear land for farming is called slash-and-burn
agriculture. How does this affect the atmosphere?

Evaporation of VOCs

VOCs enter the air by evaporation. VOCs are found in many products, like paints and petroleum products. Methane
is a VOC that evaporates from livestock waste and landﬁlls.

Summary

• There are many types of primary pollutants, including carbon oxides, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particu-

lates, lead, and volatile organic compounds.

• Secondary pollutants form from chemical reactions that occur when pollution is exposed to sunlight.
• Most pollutants enter the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. Burning forests and evaporation of some

chemicals account for most of the rest.

7.18 Effects of Air Pollution on the Environment

• Explain how air pollution damages the environment and human health.

Why do we treat the atmosphere like a dump?
On a smoggy day, you’re breathing garbage. Many human activities dump trash into the air. The trash is gases and
particles, but it’s still trash. Would we tolerate all this trash if it were in our houses?

Effects of Pollutants

Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution
each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer.
Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected
by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their
size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of
damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.

Types of Pollutants

This concept explores the effects of different pollutants on the environment and human health. The pollutants include
particulates, ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, heavy metals, and VOCs.

Particulates

Particulates cause lung diseases. They can also increase the risk of heart disease and the number of asthma attacks.
Particulates block sunlight from reaching Earth’s surface. This means there is less energy for photosynthesis. Less
photosynthesis means that plants and phytoplankton produce less food. This affects whole ecosystems.

Ozone

The ozone in smog may damage plants. The effects of ozone add up over time. Plants such as trees, which normally
live a long time, are most affected. Entire forests may die out if ozone levels are very high. Other plants, including
crop plants, may also be damaged by ozone. Below, you can see evidence of ozone damage ( Figure 7.34).

FIGURE 7.34
Ozone damaged snap bean plants are
shown on the left. Healthy snap bean
plants are shown on the right.

The ozone in smog is also harmful to human health. The image below shows the levels of ozone to watch out for (
Figure 7.35). Some people are especially sensitive to ozone. They can be harmed by levels of ozone that would not
affect most other people. These people include those with lung or heart problems.

FIGURE 7.35
The ozone air quality index gives the parts
of ozone per million parts of air. How
many parts of ozone are unhealthy for
everyone?

Nitrogen and Sulfur Oxides

Both nitrogen and sulfur oxides are toxic to humans. These compounds can cause lung diseases or make them worse.
Nitrogen and sulfur oxides form acid rain, which is described in the next concept.

Carbon Monoxide

Carbon monoxide (CO) is toxic to both plants and animals. CO is deadly to people in a conﬁned space, such as a
closed home. Carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, so people can’t tell when they are breathing it. That’s why
homes should have carbon monoxide detectors.

Heavy Metals

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

Heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, are toxic to living things. They can enter food chains from the atmosphere.
The metals build up in the tissues of organisms by bioaccumulation ( Figure 7.36). Heavy metals accumulate as
they are passed up a food chain. Imagine a low-level consumer eating a producer. That consumer takes in all of the
heavy metals from all of the producers that it eats. Then a higher-level consumer eats the low-level consumer. The
higher-level consumer accumulates all of the heavy metals from all of the lower-level consumers that it eats. In this
way, an organism accumulates a lot of heavy metals. At high levels in the food chain, the heavy metals may become
quite concentrated.

FIGURE 7.36
This diagram shows how mercury bioac-
cumulates. Compare the parts per million
(ppm) of mercury in phytoplankton and
gull eggs. Can you explain the differ-
ence?

The higher up a food chain that humans eat, the greater the levels of toxic metals they take in. That’s why people
should avoid eating too much large ﬁsh, such as tuna. Tuna are predators near the top of their food chains. They
have been shown to contain high levels of mercury. In people, heavy metals can damage the brain and other organs.
Unborn babies and young children are most affected. That’s because their organs are still developing.

VOCs

VOCs are toxic to humans and other living things. In people, they can cause a wide range of problems. These can
range from eye and nose irritation to brain damage and cancer. Levels of VOCs are often higher indoors than out.
That’s because they are released by products such as paints, cleaning solutions, and building materials. How might
you reduce your exposure to VOCs?

Summary

• An increase in particulates may have these effects. It may reduce photosynthesis, increase precipitation, and

reduce temperatures.

• Ozone may damage native plants and some crop plants. Ozone may slow plant growth or damage leaves.
• Pollutants emitted into the air cause lung and other diseases in humans.

7.19 Acid Rain

• Explain how acid rain forms.
• Describe the consequences of acid rain.

What would the artists think?
Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris opened in 1345. Construction took almost 200 years. For about 500 years, the
cathedral was pristine. Yet this gargoyle has pits in it. The pits are caused by acid rain. Acid rain forms from
pollutants from fossil fuel burning.

Acid Rain

Acid rain is rain that has a pH less than 5 ( Figure 7.37). Acidity is measured on the pH scale. Lower numbers are
more acidic, and higher numbers are less acidic (also called more alkaline). An acid has a pH of less than 7. The
pH of normal rain is 5.6. It’s slightly acidic because carbon dioxide in the air dissolves in rain. This forms carbonic
acid, a weak acid.

How Acid Rain Forms

Acid rain forms when nitrogen and sulfur oxides in air dissolve in rain ( Figure 7.38). This forms nitric and sulfuric
acids. Both are strong acids. Acid rain with a pH as low as 4.0 is now common in many areas. Acid fog may be
even more acidic than acid rain. Fog with a pH as low as 1.7 has been recorded. That’s the same pH as toilet bowl
cleaner!

This pH scale includes both normal and
acid rain. At what pH do ﬁsh have prob-
lems reproducing?

FIGURE 7.38
Nitrogen and sulfur oxides combine with
rain to form acid rain.

Effects of Acid Rain

The image below shows some of the damage done by acid rain ( Figure 7.39). Acid rain ends up in soil and bodies
of water. This can make them very acidic. The acid strips soil of its nutrients. These changes can kill trees, ﬁsh,
and other living things. Acid rain also dissolves limestone and marble. This can damage buildings, monuments, and
statues.

Summary

• Nitrogen and sulfur compounds emitted high into the atmosphere create acids. These acids may fall as acid

rain.

• Acidity is measured on a pH scale. Rain that is 5.0 or less on that scale is considered acid rain.
• Acid rain weakens plants and animals and damages cultural treasures.

7.20 Ozone Depletion

• Explain how a hole in the ozone layer forms.
• Describe the effects of ozone loss on the environment and life.

Why can’t the children in Punta Arenas go outside to play in the spring?
Punta Arenas, Chile is the world’s most southern city. At such a high latitude, winters are exceedingly cold and
dark. Unlike the children pictured above, the children in Punta Arenas must stay inside to avoid the cold. Of course,
they look forward to spring when they can go out to play. But some years, it is too dangerous for the children to go
outside. The ozone hole has moved north. Too much of the Sun’s harmful UV radiation gets through.

Loss of High-Level Ozone

Ozone near the ground harms human health. Ground-level ozone is a pollutant. But the ozone layer in the
stratosphere protects us from harmful solar rays. That’s why people were alarmed in the 1980s to learn that there
was a hole in the ozone layer.

Cause of Ozone Loss

What’s destroying the ozone layer? The chief cause is chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs). These are human-made
chemicals that contain the element chlorine (Cl). In the past, CFCs were widely used in spray cans, refrigerators,
and many other products. CFCs are stable compounds that can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.
Once CFCs are in the air, they ﬂoat up into the stratosphere. What happens next is pictured below ( Figure 7.40).
Sunlight breaks apart the molecules. This releases their chlorine ions (Cl). The free chlorine ions may then combine
with oxygen ions in ozone. This breaks down the ozone molecules into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen ion. One
CFC molecule can break down as many as 100,000 ozone molecules in this way! These forms of oxygen do not
protect the planet from ultraviolet radiation.

532

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

FIGURE 7.40
CFCs break down ozone in the strato-
sphere.

Ozone Hole

Most ozone loss it taking place over the South Pole and Antarctica. This is the location of the ozone hole. The
ozone hole is a region in the stratosphere where there is less ozone than normal. Conditions are just right for ozone
destruction because it is exceedingly cold. The ozone hole is also seasonal. The hole forms during the early part
spring in the Southern Hemisphere and then grows northward ( Figure 7.41). The ozone layer is also thinner over
the Northern Hemisphere.

FIGURE 7.41
The hole in the ozone layer occurs over
Antarctica. How do you think the hole in
the ozone layer could affect life on Earth?

533

7.20. Ozone Depletion

Effects of Ozone Loss

www.ck12.org

With less ozone in the stratosphere, more UV rays reach the ground. More UV rays increase skin cancer rates. Just a
1 percent loss of ozone causes a 5 percent increase in skin cancer. More UV rays also harm plants and phytoplankton.
As a result, they produce less food. This may affect entire ecosystems.

Protecting the Ozone Layer

The Montreal Protocol is a worldwide agreement on air pollution. It focuses on CFCs. It was signed by many
countries in 1987. It controls almost 100 chemicals that can damage the ozone layer. Its aim is to return the ozone
layer to its normal state.
The Montreal Protocol has been effective in controlling CFCs. By 1995, few CFCs were still being used. But the
ozone hole kept growing for several years after that because of the CFCs already in the atmosphere. It peaked in
2006. Since then, it has been somewhat smaller. The Montreal Protocol is a shining example of how nations can
come together to solve a global environmental problem.

Summary

• CFCs ﬂoat up into the stratosphere where they break apart. The chlorine pulls an oxygen ion off of an ozone

molecule and destroys it.

• The ozone hole forms over Antarctica in the spring.
• Ozone loss increases the amount of high-energy ultraviolet radiation that strikes Earth. This can cause

ecological and health problems.

7.21 Reducing Air Pollution

• Describe ways to reduce air pollution.

Can a car run on hydrogen?
Yes! But so far this is not feasible for more than just a few models. A major problem with hydrogen cars is the lack
of hydrogen fuel. Many ways to reduce pollution are being developed. What can you do to help?

The Clean Air Act

Air quality is a measure of the pollutants in the air. More pollutants mean poorer air quality. Poor air quality started
to become a serious problem after the Industrial Revolution. Factories burned coal for energy. Gasoline burned
by cars and trucks added greatly to air pollution. By the mid-1900s, air quality in many big cities was very bad.
Incidents in London and in U.S. cities alerted people to the extent of the problem. It was clear that air quality needed
to be protected.
In 1970 in the U.S., the Clean Air Act was passed. It limits what can be released into the air. The air in the U.S.
is much cleaner now than it was 50 years ago. But air pollution has not gone away. Vehicles, factories, and power
plants still release more than 150 million tons of pollutants into the air each year.

Reducing Pollutants from Fossil Fuels

There are two basic types of strategies for reducing pollution from fossil fuels:

1. Use less fossil fuel.
2. Prevent pollutants from entering the air.

536

www.ck12.org

Use Less Fossil Fuel

We can reduce our use of fossil fuels in several ways:

Chapter 7. Atmospheric Processes

• Conserve fossil fuels. For example, turning out lights when we aren’t using them saves electricity. Why does

this help? A lot of the electricity we use comes from coal-burning power plants.

• Use fossil fuels more efﬁciently. For example, driving a fuel-efﬁcient car lets you go farther on each gallon of

gas. This can add up to a big savings in fossil fuel use.

• Keep up with technology. Hybrid cars run on electricity that would be wasted during braking. These cars use
gas only as a backup fuel. As a result, they produce just 10 percent of the air pollution produced by regular
cars.

Keeping Pollutants out of the Air

Some of the pollutants from fossil fuels can be ﬁltered out of exhaust before it is released into the air ( Figure 7.42).
Other pollutants can be changed to harmless compounds before they are released. Two widely used technologies are
scrubbers and catalytic converters.

• Scrubbers are used in factories and power plants. They remove particulates and waste gases from exhaust

before it is released to the air.

• Catalytic converters are used on motor vehicles. They break down pollutants in exhaust to non-toxic com-

pounds. For example, they change nitrogen oxides to harmless nitrogen and oxygen gases.

FIGURE 7.42
Before catalytic converters were required,
cars spewed a lot of pollutants into the
air. On the left is a car without a catalytic
converter. The car on the right has one.

Increasing Alternative Energy Sources

Developing alternative energy sources is important. What are some of the problems facing wider adoption of
alternative energy sources?

• The technologies are still being developed. This includes sources of alternative energy, like solar and wind.
• Solar and wind are still expensive relative to fossil fuels. The technology needs to advance so that the price

falls.

537

7.21. Reducing Air Pollution

www.ck12.org

• Some areas get low amounts of sunlight and are not suited for solar. Others do not have much wind. It is
important that regions develop what best suits them. The desert Southwest will need to develop solar. The
Great Plains can use wind energy. Perhaps some locations will rely on nuclear power.

Ways You Can Reduce Air Pollution

Everyone can help to reduce air pollution. Just use less fossil fuels! How can you do this?

• Ride a bike or walk instead of driving.
• Take a bus or carpool.
• Buy a fuel efﬁcient car.
• Turn off lights and appliances when they are not in use.
• Use energy efﬁcient light bulbs and appliances.
• Buy fewer things that are manufactured using fossil fuels.

All these actions reduce the amount of energy that power plants need to produce.

Summary

The layers of the atmosphere are divided by their temperature gradients. The lowest layer is the troposphere. All
weather takes place in this layer. The next layer is the stratosphere. The stratosphere contains the protective ozone
layer. More sunlight strikes at the Equator than at the poles. This is what drives the global winds. Warm air rises,
moves poleward, and then sinks when it meets with air moving toward the Equator. The result is six atmospheric
circulation cells around the world. There are three cells in each hemisphere. Pollutants enter the atmosphere from
a few sources. The most important is fossil fuel burning. Air pollution has bad effects on the environment and on
human health. By reducing fossil fuel use we can make the environment cleaner. When ozone depletion was found
to be a problem, the world acted. As a result, the ozone hole has stabilized. The hole will be getting smaller over the
next decades.

Introduction

Chapter 8. Weather and Climate

What’s the difference between weather and climate?
When you think of Greece, you probably think of sunshine and white buildings. Maybe a beautiful beach. All of
these are typical of Greece, which has a warm Mediterranean climate. In the winter, snow sometimes blankets the
highlands. Rarely, though, it snows in the Greek lowlands. Snow is so uncommon in Athens that when it happens
it brings the city to a standstill. The Acropolis sits on a rocky outcrop above Athens. It’s beautiful, but rare, to see
this ancient ruin covered with snow. The weather in the photo on the right is cold and snowy, but the climate is still
Mediterranean. Climate is the long-term average of weather.

8.1 Introduction to Weather

• Learn what factors make up weather.
• Understand what causes weather.

What’s the weather like?
The United States is a big country. With two coasts and a large land mass in between, there’s a chance for every kind
of weather. In the next few sections we’ll visit places that have the type of weather we’re interested in studying.

What is Weather?

All weather takes place in the atmosphere. Nearly all of it in the lower atmosphere. Weather refers to the conditions
of the atmosphere at a given time and place. Climate is the average of weather over a long time.
Imagine your grandmother who lives in a distant place calls you up. She asks what your weather is like today. What
would you say? Is it warm or cold? Sunny or cloudy? Calm or windy? Clear or rainy? What features of weather are
important to mention?
A location’s weather depends on:

• air temperature.
• air pressure.
• fog.
• humidity.
• cloud cover.

• precipitation.
• wind speed and direction.

All of these characteristics are directly related to the amount of energy that is in the system, and where that energy
is. The ultimate source of this energy is the Sun.
Weather is what we experience from day to day, or minute to minute. Weather can change rapidly.

What Causes Weather?

Weather occurs because of unequal heating of the atmosphere. The source of heat is the Sun. The general principles
behind weather can be stated simply:

• The Sun heats Earth’s surface more in some places than in others.
• Where it is warm, heat from the Sun warms the air close to the surface. If there is water at the surface, it may

cause some of the water to evaporate.

• Warm air is less dense, so it rises. When this happens, more dense air ﬂows in to take its place. The ﬂowing

surface air is wind.

• The rising air cools as it goes higher in the atmosphere. If it is moist, the water vapor may condense. Clouds

may form, and precipitation may fall.

Summary

• A region’s weather depends on its air temperature, air pressure, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and

direction, and other factors.

• Climate is the long-term average of weather.
• Weather can change in minutes, but climate changes very slowly.

8.2 Humidity

• Explain how humidity affects temperature.
• Understand humidity, relative humidity, and dew point.

Would you rather spend a summer day in Phoenix or in Houston?
People who live in Phoenix, Arizona are told that summer isn’t so bad because "it’s a dry heat." What does that
mean? Imagine that both Phoenix and Houston have a temperature of 90°F. In Phoenix, the relative humidity is
20%. In Houston, the relative humidity is 90%. So in Phoenix it feels like it’s 90°. But in Houston it feels like it’s
122! Of course in Phoenix in July, the average high temperature is 106°. That’s hot, dry or not!

Humidity

Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation.

Relative Humidity

Humidity usually refers to relative humidity. This is the percent of water vapor in the air relative to the total amount
the air can hold. How much water vapor can the air hold? That depends on temperature. Warm air can hold more
water vapor than cool air ( Figure 8.1).

Humidity and Heat

People often say, “it’s not the heat but the humidity.” Humidity can make a hot day feel even hotter. When sweat
evaporates, it cools your body. But sweat can’t evaporate when the air already contains as much water vapor as it
can hold. The heat index ( Figure 8.2) is a measure of what the temperature feels like because of the humidity.

Dew Point

You’ve probably noticed dew on the grass on a summer morning. Why does dew form? Remember that the land
heats up and cools down fairly readily. So when night comes, the land cools. Air that was warm and humid in the
daytime also cools over night. As the air cools, it can hold less water vapor. Some of the water vapor condenses on
the cool surfaces, such as blades of grass. The temperature at which water vapor condenses is called the dew point.
If this temperature is below freezing, ice crystals of frost form instead of dew ( Figure 8.3). The dew point occurs
at 100 percent relative humidity. Can you explain why?

Summary

• Air reaches its dew point when humidity increases or temperature decreases.
• Water droplets form when the air reaches 100% humidity. If the temperature is cold enough, frost will form.
• Relative humidity is how the air feels at its temperature and humidity.

8.3 Clouds

• Explain how clouds form.
• Describe the inﬂuence of clouds on weather.
• Describe different types of clouds

Where should you go if you don’t want to see the Sun?
The Paciﬁc Northwest has the most days of heavy cloud cover. 62% of days have more than three-quarters of the
sky covered in clouds in Seattle. Conditions are nearly the same in Portland, Oregon. If you want to see the most
sunshine, the least cloudy cities are in Arizona.

Clouds

Clouds form when air in the atmosphere reaches the dew point. Clouds may form anywhere in the troposphere.
Clouds that form on the ground are called fog.

How Clouds Form

Clouds form when water vapor condenses around particles in the air. The particles are specks of matter, such as dust
or smoke. Billions of these tiny water droplets come together to make up a cloud. If the air is very cold, ice crystals
form instead of liquid water.

Classiﬁcation of Clouds

Clouds are classiﬁed on the basis of where and how they form. Three main types of clouds are cirrus, stratus, and
cumulus; there are other types of clouds, as well ( Figure 8.4).

• Cirrus clouds form high in the troposphere. Because it is so cold they are made of ice crystals. They are
thin and wispy. Cirrus clouds don’t usually produce precipitation, but they may be a sign that wet weather is
coming.

• Stratus clouds occur low in the troposphere. They form in layers that spread horizontally and may cover the
entire sky like a thick blanket. Stratus clouds that produce precipitation are called nimbostratus. The preﬁx
nimbo- means “rain.”

• Cumulus clouds are white and puffy. Convection currents make them grow upward, and they may grow very

tall. When they produce rain, they are called cumulonimbus.

Find the cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocu-
mulus clouds in the ﬁgure. What do they
have in common? They all form high in
the troposphere. Clouds that form in the
mid troposphere have the preﬁx “alto-”, as
in altocumulus. Where do stratocumulus
clouds form?

Clouds and Temperature

Clouds can affect the temperature on Earth’s surface. During the day, thick clouds block some of the Sun’s rays.
This keeps the surface from heating up as much as it would on a clear day. At night, thick clouds prevent heat from
radiating out into space. This keeps the surface warmer than it would be on a clear night.

Summary

• Water vapor condenses on particles in the air to form clouds.
• Clouds block sunlight in the day. Clouds trap heat in the atmosphere at night.
• Cloud types include cirrus, stratus, and cumulus.

8.4 Fog

• Describe different types of fog.

Where is the most famous fog in the U.S.?
San Francisco, the city by the bay, is known for its fog. There’s an old joke: "I spent the coldest winter of my life
in San Francisco one summer." That’s because of the fog! There is a big difference in temperature between the two
sides of the city. On the Paciﬁc side, where there is fog, temperatures are low. On the bay side, where there isn’t fog,
temperatures are much higher.

Fog

Fog ( Figure 8.5) is a cloud on the ground. Fog forms when humid air near the ground cools below its dew point.
Each type of fog forms in a different way.

• Radiation fog forms at night. Skies are clear, and the relative humidity is high. The ground cools as
temperature goes down. Air near the ground cools below its dew point. Tule fog is an extreme form of
radiation fog. This type of fog strikes the Central Valley of California in winter.

• Advection fog is famous in San Francisco, California. Warm, moist air comes in from the Paciﬁc Ocean. The
air blows over the cold California current. When the air cools below its dew point, fog forms. Sea breezes
bring the fog onshore.

• Steam fog appears in autumn when cool air moves over a warm lake. Water evaporates from the lake surface.

As the water vapor cools, it condenses. The fog appears like steam.

• Warm humid air travels up a hillside and cools below its dew point to create upslope fog.

Fog levels are declining along the California coast as climate warms. The change in fog may have big ecological
changes for the state.

8.5 Precipitation

• Describe different types of precipitation and the conditions that create them.

Want to stay dry? Don’t go to these places!
The wettest locations in the world are in Mawsynram and Cherrapunji in India. Monsoon rains result in more than
460" of rain annually. The wettest place in the United States with 404" on average is on Maui (Big Bog). The wettest
place in the continental United States is Langlois, Oregon with a mere 122" per year.

Precipitation

Clouds are needed for precipitation. Precipitation is water that falls from the sky. This may fall as liquid water,
mostly as rain. It may fall also as frozen water, such as snow.

Why Precipitation Falls

Millions of water molecules in a cloud must condense to make a single raindrop or snowﬂake. The drop or ﬂake
falls when it becomes too heavy for updrafts to keep it aloft. As a drop or ﬂake falls, it may collect more water and
get larger.

Types of Precipitation

Why does it snow instead of rain? Air temperature determines which type of precipitation falls. Rain falls if the
air temperature is above freezing (0° C or 32° F). Frozen precipitation falls if the air or ground is below freezing.
Frozen precipitation may fall as snow, sleet, or freezing rain. Below, you can see how the different types form (
Figure 8.6).

Summary

• Precipitation falls when it gets too heavy to stay in a cloud.
• Rain droplets caught up in air currents within a cloud get larger by the addition of condensed droplets until

they are too heavy and they fall.

• If the ground is very cold, rain can freeze to become sleet or glaze.

8.6 Air Masses

• Explain how air masses form, move, and inﬂuence weather.

Pick an air mass!
A cold dry air mass forms over the interior of Alaska. The mountain is Mt. McKinley in Denali National Park. A
warm wet air mass forms over the ocean. It sneaks onto the coastal area. Which region would you like to visit?

Air Masses

An air mass is a large body of air that has about the same conditions throughout. For example, an air mass might
have cold dry air. Another air mass might have warm moist air. The characteristics of an air mass depend on where
the air mass formed. The air must stay over that location long enough to pick up those characteristics.

Formation of Air Masses

Most air masses form over polar or tropical regions. They may form over continents or oceans. Air masses are moist
if they form over oceans. They are dry if they form over continents. Air masses that form over oceans are called
maritime air masses. Those that form over continents are called continental air masses. The image below shows air
masses that form over or near North America ( Figure 8.7).
An air mass takes on the conditions of the area where it forms. For example, a continental polar air mass has cold
dry air. A maritime polar air mass has cold moist air. Which air masses have warm moist air? Where do they form?

557

8.6. Air Masses

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 8.7
North American air masses.

Movement of Air Masses

When a new air mass moves over a region it brings its characteristics to the region. This may change the area’s
temperature and humidity. Moving air masses cause the weather to change when they contact different conditions.
For example, a warm air mass moving over cold ground may cause an inversion.
Why do air masses move? Winds and jet streams push them along. Cold air masses tend to move toward the Equator.
Warm air masses tend to move toward the poles. The Coriolis effect causes them to move on a diagonal. Many air
masses move toward the northeast over the U.S. This is the same direction that global winds blow.

www.ck12.org

8.7 Weather Fronts

• Deﬁne different types of fronts.
• Explain how fronts create changes in weather.

What happens when one air mass meets another?
This sight is common when one air mass meets another. You can almost see one air mass being pushed up over the
other. When two air masses meet, the result is often a storm. Have you been to the Midwestern United States in the
spring? This is a common sight.

Fronts

When cold air masses move south from the poles, they run into warm air masses moving north from the tropics.
The boundary between two air masses is called a front. Air masses usually don’t mix at a front. The differences
in temperature and pressure cause clouds and precipitation. Types of fronts include cold, warm, occluded, and
stationary fronts.

Cold Fronts

A cold front forms when a cold air mass runs into a warm air mass ( Figure 8.8). The cold air mass moves faster
than the warm air mass. So the cold air mass lifts the warm air mass out of its way. As the warm air rises, its water
vapor condenses. Clouds form, and precipitation falls. If the warm air is very humid, precipitation can be heavy.
Temperature and pressure differences between the two air masses cause winds. Winds may be very strong along a
cold front.
As the fast-moving cold air mass keeps advancing, so does the cold front. Cold fronts often bring sudden changes in
the weather. There may be a thin line of storms right at the front that moves as it moves. In the spring and summer,

Chapter 8. Weather and Climate

FIGURE 8.8
Cold fronts often bring stormy weather.

the storms may be thunderstorms and tornadoes. In the late fall and winter, the storms may bring snow. After a cold
front passes, the cold air mass behind it brings cooler temperatures. The air is likely to be less humid as well. Can
you explain why?

Warm Fronts

When a warm air mass runs into a cold air mass, it creates a warm front ( Figure 8.9). The warm air mass is moving
faster than the cold air mass. The warm air mass then ﬂows up over the cold air mass. As the warm air rises, it cools.
This brings about clouds and sometimes light precipitation. Warm fronts move slowly and cover a wide area. After
a warm front passes, the warm air mass behind it brings warmer temperatures. The warm air is also likely to be more
humid.

FIGURE 8.9
Warm fronts generally bring cloudy
weather.

561

8.7. Weather Fronts

Occluded Fronts

www.ck12.org

With an occluded front, a warm air mass becomes trapped between two cold air masses. The warm air is lifted up
above the cold air ( Figure 8.10). Cloudy weather and precipitation along the front are typical.

FIGURE 8.10
How does an occluded front differ from a
warm or cold front?

Stationary Fronts

Sometimes two air masses stop moving when they meet. These stalled air masses create a stationary front. Such a
front may bring clouds and precipitation to the same area for many days.

Summary

• Much of the weather occurs at fronts, where air masses meet.
• In a warm front, a warm air mass slides over a cold air mass. In a cold front, a cold air mass slides under a

warm air mass.

• An occluded front has three air masses: cold, warm, and cold.

8.8 Thunderstorms

• Explain how thunderstorms form, grow, and produce lightning and thunder.

How do you get struck by lightning?
An average of 55 people die from lightning strikes each year in the United States. Here’s your best chance for being
struck by lightning, according to NASA. Go golﬁng on a July Sunday at around 4 pm, especially in Florida. The
golf club up in the air acts as a lightning rod. The late afternoon in July is a great time for thunderstorms. Florida
is prone to thunderstorms, and Sunday is a day on which a lot of people like to golf. In other words, don’t do these
things!

Thunderstorms

Thunderstorms are are known for their heavy rains and lightning. In strong thunderstorms, hail and high winds are
also likely. Thunderstorms are very common. Worldwide, there are about 14 million of them each year! In the U.S.,
they are most common—and strongest—in the Midwest.

Thunderstorm Formation

Thunderstorms form when the ground is really hot ( Figure 8.12). The air near the ground becomes very warm
and humid. This is true in some locations in late afternoon or early evening in spring and summer. The warm air
rises rapidly, which creates strong updrafts. When the rising air cools, its water vapor condenses. The updrafts
create tall cumulonimbus clouds. Winds blow the cloud top sideways. This makes the well-known anvil shape
of a cloud known as a thunderhead ( Figure 8.11). Water droplets and ice ﬂy up through the cloud. When these
droplets get heavy enough, they fall. This starts a downdraft. A convection cell develops within the cloud. A mature
thunderstorm produces gusty winds, lightning, heavy rain, and hail.

Chapter 8. Weather and Climate

FIGURE 8.11
A thunderhead is a cumulonimbus cloud.

FIGURE 8.12
Formation and disappearance of a thun-
derstorm.

Lightning and Thunder

During a thunderstorm, some parts of a thunderhead become negatively charged. Other parts become positively
charged. The difference in charge creates lightning. Lightning ( Figure 8.13) is a huge release of electricity.
Lightning can jump between oppositely charged parts of the same cloud, between one cloud and another, or between
a cloud and the ground. Lightning blasts the air with energy. The air heats and expands so quickly that it explodes.
This creates the loud sound of thunder.
Do you know why you always hear the boom of thunder after you see the ﬂash of lightning? It’s because light travels
faster than sound. If you count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder, you can estimate how far
away the lightning was. A lapse of ﬁve seconds is equal to about a mile.

The End

The downdrafts cool the air at the base of the cloud. The air is no longer warm enough to rise. Convection shuts
down and the thunderhead runs out of energy. A thunderstorm usually ends only 15 to 30 minutes after it begins.
New thunderstorms may start in the same area.
Many thunderstorms form individually. During some seasons, they form in squall lines, long lines of thunderstorms,
along a cold front. Squall lines form in spring and early summer in the Midwestern United States. This is because
the maritime tropical (mT) air mass from the Gulf of Mexico meets the continental polar (cP) air mass from Canada

Summary

• Thunderstorms grow where ground temperatures are extremely high.
• Convection in the cloud causes raindrops or hailstones to grow. Downdrafts ultimately end convection.

Where do you go to see a tornado? Tornado Alley!
Tornadoes are deadly serious. The deadliest in recent years killed 158 people in Joplin, Missouri in 2011. More than
550 people died in the United States from tornadoes that year. The deadliest tornado on record killed 629 people in
1926. This "tri-state" tornado raced across Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana.

Tornadoes

Severe thunderstorms have a lot of energy and strong winds. This allows them to produce tornadoes. A tornado
( Figure 8.15) is a funnel-shaped cloud of whirling high winds. The funnel moves along the ground, destroying
everything in its path. As it moves, it loses energy. Before this happens, it may have gone up to 25 kilometers (16
miles). Fortunately, tornadoes are narrow. They may be only 150 meters (500 feet) wide. Tornadoes are also called
twisters.

Classifying Tornadoes

The winds of a tornado can reach very high speeds. The faster the winds blow, the greater the damage they cause.
Wind speed and damage are used to classify tornadoes ( Table 8.1).

Tornado Alley

Look at the map below ( Figure 8.16). It shows where the greatest number of tornadoes occur in the U.S. Tornadoes
can happen almost anywhere in the U.S., but only this area is called “Tornado Alley.” Why do so many tornadoes
occur here? This is where warm air masses from the south run into cold air masses from the north.

April 2011

Late April 2011 saw the deadliest set of tornadoes in more than 25 years. There were more than 150 tornadoes
reported throughout the day! Severe thunderstorms came about when two very different air masses met. A warm
moist air mass blew north from the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico (mT). It rammed into a cold polar air mass
(cP) that the was sitting over the region. In addition, the jet stream was blowing strongly in from the west ( Figure
8.18).

Everyone in the region was told that tornadoes were possible. But it’s impossible to know exactly where and when
a tornado will touch down. The path it will take is unknown, because tornado movement is not very predictable.

8.10 Mid-Latitude Cyclones

• Describe mid-latitude cyclones.
• Describe nor’easters.

Did you go out on Halloween in 2011?
If you did, you probably don’t live in the northeastern United States.
In much of the region, Halloween was
postponed in 2011. A large and early nor’easter struck the area. The massive storm dropped as much as 32 inches
of snow. It caused over three million people to lose power. In all, 39 people died.

Mid-Latitude Cyclones

Cyclones can be the most intense storms on Earth. A cyclone is a system of winds that rotate around a low pressure
center. The swirling air rises and cools. This creates clouds and precipitation.
Mid-latitude cyclones form at the polar front. Two very different air masses blow past each other in opposite
directions. The Coriolis effect causes winds to strike the polar front at an angle. Warm and cold fronts form next to
each other.
Most winter storms in the middle latitudes, including most of the United States and Europe, are caused by mid-
latitude cyclones ( Figure 8.19).

FIGURE 8.19
A hypothetical mid-latitude cyclone affecting the United Kingdom. The
arrows point the wind direction and its relative temperature; L is the low
pressure area. Notice the warm, cold, and occluded fronts.

The warm air at the cold front rises and creates a low pressure cell. Winds rush into the low pressure. This creates
a rising column of air. The air twists, rotating counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the
Southern Hemisphere. Since the rising air is moist, rain or snow falls.

572

www.ck12.org

Chapter 8. Weather and Climate

Mid-latitude cyclones form in winter in the mid-latitudes. The storms move eastward with the westerly winds. These
two- to ﬁve-day storms can reach 1,000 to 2,500 km (625 to 1,600 miles) in diameter. They can produce winds up
to 125 km (75 miles) per hour.

Nor’easters

Mid-latitude cyclones are especially ﬁerce in the mid-Atlantic and New England states. They are called nor’easters
because they come from the northeast. About 30 nor’easters strike the region each year ( Figure 8.20).

FIGURE 8.20
The 1993 “Storm of the Century” was a nor’easter that covered the entire
eastern seaboard of the United States.

An online guide to mid-latitude cyclones from the University of Illinois is found here: http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc
.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/cyc/home.rxml .

Summary

• A cyclone is a system of winds rotating around an area of low pressure.
• A mid-latitude cyclone forms at the polar front. This occurs when the temperature difference between air

masses is very large.

• Nor’easters are mid-latitude cyclones that come from the northeast.

8.11 Hurricanes

• Describe hurricane formation and the damage they cause.
• Describe how hurricanes are measured.

Ever been to The Big Easy?
New Orleans, Louisiana is a city unlike any other. The city is known for it’s Cajun food, jazz music, and full out
celebration of Mardi Gras. Residents love the city with a great intensity. Yet, many people who evacuated before
Hurricane Katrina have not returned. The population is nearly 30% lower than it was in August 2005. Many sections
of the city have still not recovered.

Hurricanes

Tornadoes may also come from hurricanes. A hurricane ( Figure 8.21) is an enormous storm with high winds and
heavy rains. Hurricanes may be hundreds of kilometers wide. They may travel for thousands of kilometers. The
storm’s wind speeds may be greater than 251 kilometers (156 miles) per hour. Hurricanes develop from tropical
cyclones. Hurricanes are called typhoons in the Paciﬁc.

Hurricane Formation

Hurricanes are cyclones. Since they form in the tropics, they are called tropical cyclones. These storms form over
very warm ocean water in summer and autumn. The temperature of the sea surface must be 28oC (82oF) or higher.
The air above the water warms and rises. This forms a low pressure cell. The air begins to rotate around the low

pressure cell. Water vapor condenses. If conditions are right, the storm will build into a hurricane in two to three
days.
Hurricanes are huge and produce high winds. Rainfall can be as high as 2.5 cm (1") per hour. The total rainfall
can be 20 billion metric tons daily. The enormous amounts of energy released could equal the total annual electrical
power consumption of the United States. That’s from just one storm. Hurricanes can also generate tornadoes.
Hurricanes move with the prevailing winds. In the Northern Hemisphere, they originate in the trade winds and
are blown to the west. When they reach the westerlies, they switch direction. So they travel toward the north or
northeast. You can look at a map of hurricane tracks to see this happen ( Figure 8.22). Hurricanes may cover 800
km (500 miles) in one day.

the storm at 6-hour intervals.

The Eye of a Hurricane

At the center of a hurricane is a small area where the air is calm and clear. This is called the eye of the hurricane (
Figure 8.23). The eye forms at the low-pressure center of the hurricane. Air in the eye rises upward.

576

www.ck12.org

Chapter 8. Weather and Climate

FIGURE 8.23
The eye of this hurricane is easy to see from space.

The End

Since hot water gives a hurricane its energy, the storm will grow stronger as long as it stays over the warm ocean. If
it goes ashore or moves over cooler water, it is cut off from the hot water energy. This sill cause the storm to lose
strength and slowly fade away.
Hurricanes typically last for ﬁve to ten days. The winds push them until they are over cooler water or land. When a
hurricane disintegrates, it is replaced with intense rains and tornadoes.

Classifying Hurricanes

Like tornadoes, hurricanes are classiﬁed on the basis of wind speed and damage ( Table 8.2).

Damage

So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm
surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of
the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause ﬂooding when it reaches land
( Figure 8.24). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If
577
the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can ﬂood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide,
the water will rise even higher.

FIGURE 8.24
Storm surge can cause serious ﬂooding.

Hurricane Katrina

The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was unprecedented. The hurricane season was longer than normal, and there
were many more storms. The damage from the storms was the greatest in history. The total cost was estimated at
more than $128 billion. There were more than 2,280 deaths.
Hurricane Katrina was both the most destructive hurricane and the most deadly. When the levees that protect the city
broke, much of the city was ﬂooded ( Figure 8.25). The hurricane was the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history.
Nearly 2,000 people died, and damage was estimated at over $80 billion.

Summary

• Hurricanes are cyclones that form in tropical latitudes. They are called tropical cyclones.
• Hurricanes have high winds that blow around a low pressure zone.

In the low pressure zones, air moves

upward. This is the eye of the hurricane.

• The damage hurricanes cause is due largely to storm surge. High wind speeds and rain also cause damage.
• Hurricane Katrina was so damaging because the levees that protected New Orleans broke.

8.12 Blizzards

• Describe the conditions that create blizzards.
• Explain how lake-effect snow forms.

Where are the snowiest cities in the United States?
Eight of the top ten cities with the highest average snowfall are in upstate New York. This region gets so much snow
because it is on the leeward side of the Great Lakes. The area receives lake-effect snow. If you plan to visit in winter,
strap on your snow shoes!

Winter Storms

Like hurricanes, winter storms develop from cyclones. But in the case of winter storms, the cyclones form at higher
latitudes. In North America, cyclones often form when the jet stream dips south in the winter. This lets dry polar air
pour south. At the same time, warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico ﬂows north. When the two air masses meet,
the differences in temperature and pressure cause strong winds and heavy precipitation. Blizzards and lake-effect
snow storms are two types of winter storms that occur in the U.S.

Blizzards

A blizzard ( Figure 8.26) is a snow storm that has high winds. To be called a blizzard, a storm must have winds
greater than 56 kilometers (35 miles) per hour and visibility of 1
Blizzards are dangerous storms. The wind may blow the snow into deep drifts. Along with the poor visibility, the
snow drifts make driving risky. The wind also makes cold temperatures more dangerous. The greater the wind

4 mile or less because of wind-blown snow.

speed, the higher the windchill. Windchill is what the temperature feels like when the wind is taken into account. It
depends on air temperature and wind speed ( Figure 8.27). Higher windchill will cause a person to suffer frostbite
and other harmful effects of cold sooner than if the wind isn’t blowing.

FIGURE 8.27
Windchill temperatures may be very low
in blizzards because of
the high wind
speeds. How long does it take for frostbite
to occur when the air temperature is 0° F
and the wind speed is 55 miles per hour?

Lake-Effect Snow

Some places receive very heavy snowfall just about every winter. If they are near a lake, they may be getting lake-
effect snow. The image below shows how lake-effect snow occurs ( Figure 8.28). Winter winds pick up moisture
as they pass over the relatively warm waters of a large lake. When the winds reach the cold land on the other side,
the air cools. Since there was so much moisture in the air, it can drop a lot of snow. More than 254 centimeters (100
inches) of snow may fall in a single lake-effect storm!

Summary

• Blizzards are often part of a mid-latitude cyclone. The jet stream brings cold air into contact with warm moist

air.

• The difference in pressure between the air masses brings about strong winds.
• Cold polar air absorbs moisture as it travels over the Great Lakes. The air cools when it goes back over land

and then dumps snow. This creates lake-effect snow.

8.13 Heat Waves and Droughts

• Describe the causes of heat waves.
• Describe the causes of droughts.

Is the current drought like the Dust Bowl?
The worst heat wave in U.S. history came in 1936. The already struggling Midwest was hit hard by extreme
temperatures and drought. Crops were destroyed, and more than 5,000 people died. The Midwest and Southwest are
currently suffering with drought. While serious, it is not yet a situation like the Dust Bowl.

Heat Waves

A heat wave is different depending on its location. A region has a heat wave if it has more than ﬁve consecutive
days of temperatures that are more than 9oF (5oC) above average. A heat wave in Portland, Oregon might be just an
average warm week in Phoenix, Arizona.
Heat waves have increased in frequency and duration in recent years. The summer 2011 North American heat wave
brought record temperatures across the Midwestern and Eastern United States. Many states and localities broke
records for temperature and for the most days above 100oF.

Causes

A high pressure cell sitting over a region with no movement is the likely cause of a heat wave.
What do you think caused the heat wave in the image below ( Figure 8.29)? A high pressure zone kept the jet stream
farther north than normal for August.

FIGURE 8.29
A heat wave over the United States as in-
dicated by heat radiated from the ground.
The bright yellow areas are the hottest,
and the blue and white are coolest.

Droughts

Droughts also depend on what is normal for a region. A region that gets signiﬁcantly less precipitation than normal
for an extended period of time is in drought. The Southern United States is experiencing an ongoing and prolonged
drought.
Drought has many consequences. When soil loses moisture it may blow away. This happened during the Dust Bowl
in the United States in the 1930s. Forests may be lost, dust storms may become common, and wildlife are disturbed.
Wildﬁres become much more common during times of drought.

Summary

• A heat wave or a drought is deﬁned as conditions different from normal in a region.
• A heat wave is caused when a warm high-pressure cell sits over a region.
• Drought may have extremely severe consequences. The severity depends on its duration and intensity.

8.14. Collecting Weather Data

www.ck12.org

8.14 Collecting Weather Data

• Describe how scientists collect information about weather.

What does a meteorologist need before he or she can forecast the weather?
Data! A meteorologist needs data about the current conditions. There are many types of instruments available for
collecting that data. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a 5-day weather forecast today
is as reliable as a 2-day forecast was 20 years ago.

Predicting the Weather

Weather is very difﬁcult to predict. That’s because it’s very complex, and many factors are involved. Slight changes
in even one factor can cause a big change in the weather. Still, certain “rules of thumb” generally apply. These
“rules” help meteorologists forecast the weather. For example, low pressure is likely to bring stormy weather. So if
a center of low pressure is moving your way, you can expect a storm.
People often complain when the weather forecast is wrong. Weather forecasts today, however, are much more
accurate than they were just 20 years ago. Scientists who study and forecast the weather are called meteorologists.
How do they predict the weather?
The ﬁrst thing they need is data. Their data comes from various instruments.

Weather Instruments

Weather instruments measure weather conditions. One of the most important conditions is air pressure, which is
measured with a barometer ( Figure 8.30). There are also a number of other commonly used weather instruments

586

Chapter 8. Weather and Climate

( Figure 8.31):

• A thermometer measures temperature.
• An anemometer measures wind speed.
• A rain gauge measures the amount of rain.
• A hygrometer measures humidity.
• A wind vane shows wind direction.
• A snow gauge measures the amount of snow.

FIGURE 8.30

rises inside the tube. Mercury can rise in the tube, because there’s no

8.14. Collecting Weather Data

Collecting Data

www.ck12.org

Weather instruments collect data from all over the world at thousands of weather stations ( Figure 8.32). Many are
on land, but some ﬂoat in the oceans on buoys. There’s probably at least one weather station near you.
Other weather devices are needed to collect weather data in the atmosphere. They include weather balloons,
satellites, and radar ( Figure 8.32).

FIGURE 8.32
Weather stations collect data on land and
sea. Weather balloons, satellites, and
radar collect data in the atmosphere.

Weather stations contain many instruments for measuring weather conditions. The weather balloon ( Figure 8.32)
will rise into the atmosphere until it bursts. As it rises, it will gather weather data and send it to the surface. Many
weather satellites orbit Earth. They constantly collect and transmit weather data from high above the surface. A
radar device sends out radio waves in all directions. The waves bounce off water in the atmosphere and then return to
the sender. The radar data shows where precipitation is falling. It’s raining in the orange-shaded area shown above.

Using Computers

What do meteorologists do with all that weather data? They use it in weather models. The models analyze the data
and predict the weather. The models require computers. That’s because so many measurements and calculations are
involved.

Summary

• Various instruments measure weather conditions:

thermometers measure air temperature, and barometers

measure air pressure.

8.15 Weather Maps

• Describe the information depicted on weather maps.
• Analyze weather maps.

What can a weather map tell you about the weather?
A lot! A weather map indicates all sorts of things to let you know the forecast. It also may have some cute graphics
associated with it.

Weather Maps

You may have seen weather maps like the one pictured below ( Figure 8.33). A weather map shows weather
conditions for a certain area. The map may show the actual weather on a given day. It may show the predicted
weather for some time in the future. Some weather maps show many weather conditions. Others show a single
condition.

Air Pressure Maps

The weather map pictured below ( Figure 8.33) shows air pressure. The lines on the map connect places that have
the same air pressure. Air pressure is measured in a unit called the millibar. Isobars are the lines that connect the
points with the same air pressure. The map also shows low- and high-pressure centers and fronts. Find the cold front
on the map. This cold front is likely to move toward the northeast over the next couple of days. How could you use
this information to predict what the weather will be on the East Coast?

This weather map shows air pressure
contours. Which state has the lowest air
pressure shown on the map?

Other Weather Maps

Instead of air pressure, weather maps may show other weather conditions. For example, a temperature map might
show the high and low temperatures of major cities. The map may have isotherms, lines that connect places with
the same temperature.

Summary

• Weather maps graphically depict weather conditions.
• Isobars are lines of constant pressure.
• Isobars indicate pressure cells.

8.16 Weather versus Climate

• Deﬁne climate, and know how it is different from weather.

Where in Hawaii do you want to go?
Look at a list of cities with the best climate in the United States. Hawaii is well represented. Now look at a list of
cities with the worst climate in the United States. (You know where this is going, don’t you?) Yes, Hawaii is also
represented. Kona and Hilo are both on the Big Island. Hilo is on the windward side where the trade winds bring in
moisture from the Paciﬁc. Kona is on the leeward side, beyond the high volcanic mountains. This city lies within
the rain shadow. Guess which city is more popular with tourists?

What is Climate?

Almost anything can happen with the weather. Climate, however, is more predictable. Climate is the long-term
average of weather in a particular spot. Good climate is why we choose to vacation in Hawaii in February (usually
on the leeward side). Of course, the weather is not guaranteed to be good! A location’s climate considers the
same characteristics as its weather. These are its air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and the type,
quantity, and frequency of precipitation. For climate, these things are averaged over time.
During the mid- to late-twentieth century, California received an enormous inﬂux of new residents. Many of these
people came from the northeastern United States. They were sick of the cold, snow, and rain. Southern California,
especially near the coast, has a nearly perfect climate. The average lows and highs in San Diego year round are in
the 50s, 60s, and 70s ( Figure 8.34).

FIGURE 8.34
A bike path along Mission Bay in San Diego, California.

The climate for a particular place is steady. Changes occur only very slowly. Climate is determined by many factors,

593

8.16. Weather versus Climate

including the angle of the Sun, the likelihood of cloud cover, and the air pressure. All of these factors are related to
the amount of solar energy that hits that location over time.
The climate of a region depends on its position relative to many things. These factors are described in the next
sections.

Summary

• Climate is the long-term average of weather.
• Climate changes very slowly.
• Climate depends on a number of factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and the

type, quantity, and frequency of precipitation.

8.17 Effect of Latitude on Climate

• Describe how latitude inﬂuences a region’s climate.

Do you want to be a Snowbird?
A Snowbird is usually a person who is retired. Like a migrating bird, they go where the weather is good. A snowbird
may spend summers "at home" in Michigan or New York. But they travel to Arizona or Florida to spend their winters
in the Sun and warmth. What would a reverse snowbird be? A person who spent summers in the 100+ degree heat
and winters in the sub-0 cold. Brrrr....

Latitude and Climate

Latitude is the distance north or south of the Equator. It’s measured in degrees, from 0° to 90°. Several climate
factors vary with latitude.

Latitude and Temperature

Temperature changes with latitude ( Figure 8.35).

• At the Equator, the Sun’s rays are most direct. This is where temperatures are highest.
• At higher latitudes, the Sun’s rays are less direct. The farther an area is from the Equator, the lower its

temperature.

• At the poles, the Sun’s rays are least direct. Much of the area is covered with ice and snow, which reﬂect a lot

of sunlight. Temperatures are lowest here.

How Much Does Latitude Change Temperature?

Austin, Texas; Wichita, Kansas; Fargo, North Dakota; and Thompson, Manitoba in Canada all roughly lie on the
97° west longitude line ( Figure 8.36 and Figure 8.37). But they run the length of the North America from 30°N in
Austin, to 38°N in Wichita, to 47°N in Fargo, and to 56°N in Thompson. Other factors affect their climate, but all
four cities are inland.

mate

• Explain how climate relates to the global winds.
• Describe how atmospheric circulation inﬂuences precipitation.

Would you like to go to the horse latitudes?
Imagine you’re on a sailing ship that’s carrying horses among other cargo. You want to go from Spain to northern
South America. For a smooth ride west, you need to get the ship into the trade winds. But where the trade winds and
the westerlies meet is a zone where air ﬂows vertically downward. It’s hard to get through there in a sailing ship. So
your ship gets stuck. For weeks. There’s no more water or food for the horses so you throw them overboard. Some
people think this is where the horse latitudes got their name.

More Effects of Latitude on Climate

We saw that the amount of solar radiation an area receives depends on its latitude. The amount of solar radiation
affects the temperature of a region. Latitude has other effects on climate.

Latitude and Prevailing Winds

Global air currents cause global winds. The ﬁgure below shows the direction that these winds blow ( Figure 8.38).
Global winds are the prevailing, or usual, winds at a given latitude. The winds move air masses, which causes
weather.
The direction of prevailing winds determines which type of air mass usually moves over an area. For example, a
west wind might bring warm moist air from over an ocean. An east wind might bring cold dry air from over a
mountain range. Which wind prevails has a big effect on the climate. What if the prevailing winds are westerlies?
The westerlies blow from nearer the Equator to farther from the Equator. How would they affect the climate?

The usual direction of

wind belts.

Latitude and Precipitation

Global air currents affect precipitation. How they affect it varies with latitude ( Figure 8.39). Where air rises, it
cools and there is precipitation. Where air sinks, it warms and causes evaporation. These patterns are part of the
global wind belts.

8.19 Effect of Continental Position on Climate

• Deﬁne maritime and continental climates.
• Explain how continental position and ocean currents affect climate.

Is latitude making the difference in weather in these three cities?
No. These three cities are at the same latitude. They are San Francisco, California; Wichita, Kansas; and Virginia
Beach, Virginia. Proximity to the ocean is important. Also important is the direction the winds are blowing at this
location.

Oceans and Climate

When a place is near an ocean, the water can have a big effect on the climate.

Coastal and Inland Climates

Places at the same latitude may have very different climates if one is on a coast and one is inland.

• On the coast, the climate is inﬂuenced by warm moist air from the ocean. A coastal climate is usually mild.
Summers aren’t too hot, and winters aren’t too cold. Precipitation can be high due to the moisture in the air.
This is a maritime climate.

• Farther inland, the climate is inﬂuenced by cold or hot air from the land. This air may be dry, because it comes
from over land. An inland climate is usually more extreme. Winters may be very cold, and summers may be
very hot. Precipitation can be low. This is a continental climate.

The Inﬂuence of the Ocean

The ocean has a big effect on climate. This is obvious when you compare the temperatures of these three cities.
Each of these cities is located at 37°N latitude, within the westerly winds ( Figure 8.40).
The climate of San Francisco is inﬂuenced by the Paciﬁc Ocean. The cool California current comes from the north.
Upwelling brings cold water from the deep. So the water offshore is cold. Virginia Beach is near the Atlantic Ocean.
But its temperatures are more like Wichita than San Francisco. Why is the climate in Virginia Beach less inﬂuenced
by the ocean than San Francisco? Hint: Think about the direction the winds are going at that latitude. The weather
in San Francisco comes from over the Paciﬁc Ocean. Much of the weather in Virginia comes from the continent.

How does the ocean inﬂuence the climate
of these three cities?

Ocean Currents and Climate

Ocean currents carry warm or cold water throughout the world’s oceans. They help to even out the temperatures in
the oceans. This also affects the temperature of the atmosphere and the climate around the world. Currents that are
near shore have a direct impact on climate. They may make the climate much colder or warmer. Examples of this
are pictured below ( Figure 8.41).

FIGURE 8.41
The Gulf Stream moves warm equatorial water up the western Paciﬁc and
into northern Europe. The warm water raises temperatures in the British
Isles.

Summary

• A maritime climate is inﬂuenced by a nearby ocean. A continental climate is inﬂuenced by nearby land.
• The temperature of offshore currents affect nearby land areas.
• A maritime climate is less extreme than a continental climate, because the ocean moderates temperatures.

8.20 Effect of Altitude and Mountains on Climate

• Explain how altitude and mountain ranges affect climate.
• Deﬁne rainshadow effect.

How much does the climate vary across Washington State?
The ﬁrst photo is of Olympic National Park by the Paciﬁc Ocean. The area is wet; very, very wet. Moving eastward,
you ﬁnd Mt. Baker, one of the Cascades volcanoes. The climate on the mountain is very different from the climate
near the ocean. It is extremely cold with abundant snowfall in winter. The third photo is of eastern Washington.
Much of the land is farmed. The climate is much drier for two reasons. Can you determine what they are?

Mountains and Climate

Did you ever hike or drive up a mountain? Did you notice that it was cooler near the top? Climate is not just different
on a mountain. Just having a mountain range nearby can affect the climate.

Altitude and Temperature

Air temperature falls at higher altitudes ( Figure 8.42). Why does this happen? Since air is less dense at higher
altitudes, its molecules are spread farther apart than they are at sea level. These molecules have fewer collisions, so
they produce less heat.
Look at the mountain pictured below ( Figure 8.43). The peak of Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania (Africa, 3° south
latitude) is 6 kilometers (4 miles) above sea level. At 3°S, it’s very close to the Equator. At the bottom of the
mountain, the temperature is high year round. How can you tell that it’s much cooler at the top?

Mountains and Precipitation

Mountains can also affect precipitation. Mountains and mountain ranges can cast a rain shadow. As winds rise
up the windward side of a mountain range, the air cools and precipitation falls. On the other side of the range, the
leeward side, the air is dry, and it sinks. So there is very little precipitation on the leeward side of a mountain range.
The ﬁgure below shows how this happens ( Figure 8.44).

Summary

• Where air is denser, the air temperature is higher.

8.21 Climate Zones and Biomes

• Understand the similarities in climate zones between altitude and latitude.
• Describe the major climate zones, and explain how they relate to biomes.

How are altitude and latitude similar?
The top of Mt. Humphreys (top), the highest point in Arizona, is 12,637 feet (3,852 m). Only a few plants can live
in this harsh environment. The life zone is tundra. Tundra is also seen in high latitudes, like Denali National Park in
Alaska (bottom). Denali is at 63° north.

Major Climate Types

Major climate types are based on temperature and precipitation. Latitude plays an important role in determining
the climate of a region. However, many other factors play a role in climate. Oceans and mountain ranges inﬂuence
climate in the same ways worldwide ( Figure 8.45). You can see where the climate types are on the map, and then
read about them below.
Temperature and precipitation determine what types of plants can grow in an area. Animals and other living things
depend on plants. So each climate is associated with certain types of living things. A major type of climate and its
living things make up a biome. As you read about the major climate types below, ﬁnd them on the map above (
Figure 8.45).

Altitude and Latitude

Altitude mimics latitude in climate zones. Climates and biomes typical of higher latitudes may be found at high
altitudes.
Arizona is a state with a large elevation change. In the late 1800s, C. Hart Merriam noticed that the plant life changed
with altitude in the same way it changes with latitude. So on a trip from Phoenix up to the top of the mountain, you
could see all of these life zones ( Figure 8.46):

tundra; see Mt. Humphreys above.

Microclimates

Climate conditions in a small area may be different from those of the surroundings. The climate of the small area
is called a microclimate. The microclimate of a valley may be cool relative to its surroundings since cold air sinks.
The ground surface may be hotter or colder than the air a few feet above it. This is because rock and soil gain and
lose heat readily. Different sides of a mountain will have different microclimates. In the Northern Hemisphere, a
south-facing slope receives more solar energy than a north-facing slope. Each side supports different amounts and

types of vegetation.

Whether a place is wet all year round or dry for some time really affects what can grow there. In the tropics, places
that are wet year round have lush vegetation. Places that are dry some of the time are much less lush.

Tropical Climates

Tropical climates are found around the Equator. As you’d expect, these climates have warm temperatures year round.
The warm air rises at the Equator. As it rises, it cools, causing it to rain. Tropical climates may be very wet, or wet
and dry.

Tropical Wet Climate

Tropical wet climates occur at or very near the Equator. They have high rainfall year round. Tropical rainforests (
FIgure 8.47) grow in this type of climate.

Tropical Wet and Dry Climate

Tropical wet and dry climates occur between 5° and 20° latitude and receive less rainfall. Most of the rain falls in a
single season. The rest of the year is dry. Few trees can withstand the long dry season, so the main plants are grasses
( Figure 8.48). Wildlife thrive on these grasslands.

Summary

• Tropical climates are found at or near the Equator. Because warm air rises at the Equator, there is a lot of rain.
• Tropical wet climates get rain year round. Tropical rainforests grow in this climate zone.
• Tropical wet and dry climates have a rainy season and a dry season. The vegetation is largely grass.

8.23 Dry Climates

• Deﬁne desert and steppe.
• Describe the conditions found in arid climates.

How do plants that evolved in different places end up being so similar?
Organisms evolve to ﬁt the conditions they are in. There are only so many ways to minimize the use of water. Plants
in arid climates evolve very similar structures to lessen water use. They also have structures to protect themselves
from the Sun. The cactus on the right is from South America. The cactus on the left is from North America. These
plants are just one of many examples of organisms evolving under very similar conditions and turning out to be very
similar.

Dry Climates

Dry climates receive very little rainfall. They also have high rates of evaporation. This makes them even drier.

Deserts

The driest climates are deserts. Most occur between about 15° and 30° latitude. This is where dry air sinks to the
surface in the global circulation cells. Deserts receive less than 25 centimeters (10 inches) of rain per year. They
may be covered with sand dunes or be home to sparse but hardy plants. With few clouds, many deserts have hot days
and cool nights.

Steppes

Other dry climates get a little more precipitation. They are called steppes. These regions have short grasses and low
bushes ( Figure 8.50). Steppes occur at higher latitudes than deserts. They are dry because they are in continental
interiors or rain shadows.

Summary

• Deserts receive very little rainfall. They are often home to very unusual and well adapted plants.

plants as in the right photo.

8.24 Temperate Climates

• Describe the features of temperate climate zones.

What do these photos have in common? What’s different?
Both photos have grapevines and old looking stone buildings. The Sun is shining. The photo on the right is in
California, where wine has become an enormous business in recent decades. On the left is an ancient village in
Tuscany in Italy. These locations both have a Mediterranean climate, which is good for wine, olive oil, artichokes,
and an tremendous number of other agricultural products.

Temperate Climates

Temperate climates have moderate temperatures. These climates vary in how much rain they get and when the rain
falls.

Mediterranean Climate

Mediterranean climates are found on the western coasts of continents. The latitudes are between 30° and 45°. The
coast of California has a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures are mild, and rainfall is moderate. Most of the rain
falls in the winter, and summers are dry. To make it through the dry summers, short woody plants are common (
Figure 8.51).

Marine west coast climates are also found on the western coasts of continents. They occur between 45° and 60°
latitude. The coast of Washington State has this type of climate. Temperatures are mild, and there’s plenty of rainfall
all year round. Dense ﬁr forests grow in this climate ( Figure 8.52).

FIGURE 8.52

Humid Subtropical Climate

Humid subtropical climates are found on the eastern sides of continents between about 20° and 40° latitude. The
southeastern U.S. has this type of climate. Summers are hot and humid, but winters are chilly. There is moderate
rainfall throughout the year. Pine and oak forests grow in this climate ( Figure 8.53).

FIGURE 8.53

Summary

• Different temperate climates are at different latitudes. The latitude a climate depends on where it is on a

continent.

• The Mediterranean climate has wet winters and dry summers.
• The marine west coast climate gets lots of rain from the nearby ocean.
• In the humid subtropical climate, summers are wet but winters are very cold.

8.25 Continental Climates

• Deﬁne continental climate.
• Describe the two types of continental climate.

Where don’t you go to experience a continental climate?
There are no continental climates in the Southern Hemisphere. Can you guess why? Continental climates are
between 40° and 70°. The southern continents at this latitude are too narrow. All of their inland areas are close
enough to a coast to be affected by the ocean!

Continental Climates

Continental climates are found in inland areas. They are too far from oceans to experience the effects of ocean water.
Continental climates are common between 40° and 70° north latitude.

Humid Continental Climate

Humid continental climates are found between 40° and 60° north latitude. The northeastern U.S. has this type of
climate. Summers are warm to hot, and winters are cold. Precipitation is moderate, and it falls year round. Deciduous
trees grow in this climate ( Figure 8.54). They lose their leaves in the fall and grow new ones in the spring.

Subarctic Climate

Subarctic climates are found between 60° and 70° north latitude. Much of Canada and Alaska have this type of
climate. Summers are cool and short. Winters are very cold and long. Little precipitation falls, and most of it falls
during the summer. Conifer forests grow in this climate ( Figure 8.55).

FIGURE 8.55
A conifer forest in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada.

Summary

• Continental climates are far enough way from the ocean that there is no inﬂuence.
• Deciduous trees are common in humid continental climates. Conifer forests grow in the subarctic.
• Humid continental climates have warm winters and cold summers. Subarctic climates have cool short sum-

mers and very cold winters.

www.ck12.org

8.26 Polar Climates

• Deﬁne permafrost and tundra.
• Describe the vegetation found in polar and alpine regions.

What types of animals live here?
The polar climate is harsh. Plants are small and low to the ground. What types of animals can live under these
conditions? In alpine areas, small mammals that seek protection in rocks are common. The marmot on the left is
an example. Large animals must be prepared to live exposed to frigid cold. Musk ox live in the farthest north parts
of North America and Greenland. Additionally, large animals like caribou can migrate to more hospitable places in
winter.

Polar Climates

Polar climates are found near the North and South Poles. They also occur on high mountains at lower latitudes. The
summers are very cool, and the winters are frigid. Precipitation is very low because it’s so cold. The growing season
is very short. Tundra prefers areas of permafrost. Permafrost is a lower layer of soil that is permanently frozen.
Tundra also refers to a treeless plain with small plants. You can see examples of polar climates pictured below.

Polar Tundra

The polar tundra climate ( Figure 8.56) occurs near the poles. Tundra climates have permafrost. Permafrost is layer
of ground below the surface that is always frozen, even in the summer. Only small plants, such as mosses, can grow
in this climate.

FIGURE 8.56
Polar tundra in the Northwest Territories, Canada.

Alpine Tundra

The alpine tundra climates ( Figure 8.57) occurs at high altitudes at any latitude. They are also called highland
climates. These regions are very cold because they are so far above sea level. The alpine tundra climate is very

624

www.ck12.org

Chapter 8. Weather and Climate

similar to the polar tundra climate.

FIGURE 8.57
Alpine Tundra in the Rockies, Colorado.

Ice Caps

Ice caps are areas covered with thick ice year round. Ice caps are found only in Greenland and Antarctica. Tempera-
tures and precipitation are both very low. What little snow falls usually stays on the ground. It doesn’t melt because
it’s too cold.

Summary

• Tundra is land with permafrost, no trees, and small hardy plants.
• Permafrost is land with permanently frozen soil.
• Tundra is found near the poles and up on high mountains.

8.27 Climate Change in Earth History

• Explain how Earth’s climate has changed in the past.

How important was the Pleistocene ice age to human evolution?
Climate is dynamic; climate has changed through Earth’s history. Climate has changed a lot during the time humans
have been evolving. As the climate got colder, people learned to hunt more since plants became scarce in the winter.
Better hunting required better tools. Better tools helped to spur on the evolution of culture.

How Earth’s Climate Changes

Earth’s climate has changed many times through Earth’s history. Over much of Earth’s past, the climate was warmer
than it is today. Picture in your mind dinosaurs roaming the land. They’re probably doing it in a pretty warm climate
( Figure 8.58)!

FIGURE 8.58
Dinosaurs thrived during one of the warmest periods in Earth’s history.

But ice ages also occurred many times in the past. An ice age is a period when temperatures are cooler than normal.
This causes glaciers to spread to lower latitudes. Scientists think that ice ages occurred at least six times over the
last billion years alone. How do scientists learn about Earth’s past climates?

627

8.27. Climate Change in Earth History

www.ck12.org

The last major ice age took place in the Pleistocene. This epoch lasted from 2 million to 14,000 years ago. Earth’s
temperature was only 5° C (9° F) cooler than it is today. But glaciers covered much of the Northern Hemisphere.
Below, you can see how far south they went ( Figure 8.59). Clearly, a small change in temperature can have a big
impact on the planet. Humans lived during this ice age.

FIGURE 8.59
Pleistocene glaciers covered an enormous land area. Chicago is just one
city that couldn’t have existed during the Pleistocene.

Why Climate Changes

Several natural processes may affect Earth’s temperature. They range from sunspots to Earth’s wobble.

• Sunspots are storms on the Sun. When the number of sunspots is high, the Sun gives off more energy than

usual. Still, there is little evidence for climate changing along with the sunspot cycle.

• Plate movements cause continents to drift closer to the poles or the Equator. Ocean currents also shift when

continents drift. All these changes can affect Earth’s temperature.

• Plate movements trigger volcanoes. A huge eruption could spew so much gas and ash into the air that little

sunlight wouldn’t reach the surface for months or years. This could lower Earth’s temperature.

• A large asteroid hitting Earth would throw a lot of dust into the air. This could block sunlight and cool the

planet.

• Earth goes through regular changes in its position relative to the Sun. Its orbit changes slightly. Earth also
wobbles on its axis of rotation. The planet also changes its axial tilt, the angle of its axis of rotation. These
changes can affect Earth’s temperature.

Summary

• Earth’s climate has been warmer and colder, but mostly warmer, through Earth history.
• Many natural processes change Earth’s climate. These include sunspots, plate tectonics, volcanism, asteroid

impacts, and Earth’s motions.

• The Pleistocene Ice Age lasted from 2 million to 14,000 years ago. Earth’s temperature was only 5° C (9° F)

cooler than it is today.

8.28 Short-Term Climate Change

• Learn how El Niño and La Niña differ from normal conditions.

What are short term climate changes?
El Niño and La Niña bring about dramatic changes in climate for a year or two. In some locations, one brings rain
and the other brings drought. In California, for example, El Niño years are full of snow and rain. La Niña years tend
toward drought. These variations can bring tremendous changes to living creatures. Humans are also affected; for
example, erosion from storms may be very high some years.

Short-Term Climate Change

You’ve probably heard of El Niño and La Niña. These terms refer to certain short-term changes in climate. The
changes are natural and occur in cycles, lasting from days to years. El Niño and La Niña are not the only short-term
climate changes. Others include the Paciﬁc decadal oscillation and the North Atlantic oscillation. El Niño and La
Niña are the most noticeable and discussed.
To understand El Niño and La Niña, you ﬁrst need to know what happens in normal years ( Figure 8.60).

El Niño

During an El Niño, the western Paciﬁc Ocean is warmer than usual. This causes the trade winds to change direction.
The winds blow from west to east instead of east to west ( Figure 8.61). The change in the trade winds also causes
the jet streams to be north of their normal location. The warm water travels east across the Equator, too. Warm water
piles up along the western coast of South America. This prevents upwelling. Why do you think this is true?

Chapter 8. Weather and Climate

FIGURE 8.60
This diagram represents the Paciﬁc
Ocean in a normal year. North and South
America are the brown shapes on the
right.

These changes in water temperature, winds, and currents affect climates worldwide. The changes usually last a year
or two. Some places get more rain than normal. Other places get less. In many locations, the weather is more severe.

How do you think El Niño affects climate

8.28. Short-Term Climate Change

www.ck12.org

La Niña

La Niña ( Figure 8.62) generally follows El Niño. It occurs when the Paciﬁc Ocean is cooler than normal. The
trade winds are like they are in a normal year. They blow from east to west. But in a La Niña, the winds are stronger
than usual. More cool water builds up in the western Paciﬁc. These changes can also affect climates worldwide.

FIGURE 8.62
How do you think La Niña affects climate
on the western coast of South America?

Some scientists think that global warming is affecting the cycle of El Niño and La Niña. These short-term changes
seem to be cycling faster now than in the past. They are also more extreme.
An online guide to El Niño and La Niña events from the University of Illinois is found here: http://ww2010.atmos.
uiuc.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/eln/home.rxml .

Summary

• El Niño and La Niña are two examples of short-term climate changes lasting one to a few years.
• In an El Niño, the trade winds reverse direction, as do the equatorial surface currents. This causes warm water

to pool off of South America and stop upwelling.
• A La Niña is like normal conditions only more so.

8.29 Global Warming

• Describe global warming.

How can things change so quickly?
Glaciers and ice sheets are melting. This can be seen clearly in photographs. The glaciers advanced during the
Pleistocene ice age. They have been melting back since then, except for during the Little Ice Age. However, the rate
of melting has increased tremendously in recent decades.

Temperature Variations

Since the end of the Pleistocene, Earth’s temperature has risen. The image below shows how it changed over just the
last 1500 years ( Figure 8.63). The Medieval Warm Period was a time of somewhat higher average temperatures. The
Little Ice Age was a time of somewhat lower average temperatures. But for each time, the anomaly (the difference
from average temperature) was less than 1° C (1.8° F). Still, the overall trend is slightly upward.

Recent Temperature Trends

Since the mid 1800s, Earth has warmed up quickly ( Figure 8.64). The 14 hottest years on record have all occurred
since 1900. By the end of 2013, 13 of the 14 hottest years ever have occurred since 2000! This temperature rise is
what is usually meant by global warming.

8.30 Causes and Effects of Global Warming

• Describe what causes global warming.
• Describe the consequences of global warming.

What is the human cost of warmer temperatures?
Many lands are marginal for farming. When rainfall is normal or high, the lands can produce. When rainfall is low,
no crops grow. Drought makes marginal lands unsuitable for farming. Drought can also make good lands more
difﬁcult to farm. These changes will increase as temperatures warm.

Causes of Global Warming

The average global temperature has been rising since the end of the Pleistocene. With some ups and downs, of
course. Rising temperatures are natural for this time period. But natural causes cannot explain all the warming that’s
been happening. There is some other factor at work.
Recent global warming is due mainly to human actions. The actions involve releasing greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere. Remember that greenhouse gases keep the atmosphere warm? And that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse
gas? When you burn fossil fuels, carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. The more carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere, the better the atmosphere can trap heat. In other words, an increase in greenhouse gases leads to greater
greenhouse effect. The result is increased global warming. Pictured below is the increase in carbon dioxide since
1960 ( Figure 8.65).
Burning forests also releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Other human activities release greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere. For example, growing rice and raising livestock both produce methane.

How much more carbon dioxide was in the
air in 2010 than in 1960?

Effects of Global Warming

There are already many effects of global warming being seen. As Earth has gotten warmer, sea ice has melted. This
has raised the level of water in the oceans ( Figure 8.66).

FIGURE 8.66
The overall trend in sea level since 1870;
it has risen about 9 inches.

Chapter 8. Weather and Climate

The extent of Arctic sea ice in summer has been decreasing rapidly. The ice pictured below is the sea ice minimum
in 2011 ( Figure 8.67). The yellow line is the median minimum ice extent for 1979–2000.

FIGURE 8.67
The sea ice minimum for 2011 was the
second lowest on record.

Other effects of global warming include more extreme weather. Earth now has more severe storms, ﬂoods, heat
waves, and droughts than it did just a few decades ago. Many living things cannot adjust to the changing climate.
Coral reefs in many parts of the world are struggling to survive. Species are moving uphill where temperatures are
cooler. Those at the top of the mountain are being run off. Migration and egg-laying behaviors in birds are off of
their normal. There are many more examples of the effects of changing climate.

Summary

• Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels and other human activities release green-

house gases into the atmosphere.

• Greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere are increasing. Global temperatures are increasing.
• Changes due to increasing temperatures are seen around the globe. Living organisms and humans are also

affected.

8.31 Impact of Continued Global Warming

• Describe likely impacts of continued global warming.

“The Inuit see this and the world should know this...”
“It’s happening right before our eyes” —23-year-old Jordan Konek is one of the Inuit, the native people of the
Arctic. He told this to the 2011 Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa. Native people in the Arctic
see changes much more than people in lower latitudes. More warming is occurring in the polar regions.

How Will Climate Change in the Future?

Earth’s temperature will keep rising unless greenhouse gas emissions are curbed. The temperature in 2100 may be
as much as 5° C (9° F) higher than it was in 2000. Is 5° C (9° F) a lot? It’s more than the increase in temperature
from the the times of maximum ice during the Pleistocene to now. Since the end of the Pleistocene, the temperature
has only risen about 4° C. That’s just 4° C from abundant ice to the moderate climate we have today. How might a
5° C increase in temperature affect Earth in the future?
Warming will affect the entire globe by the end of this century. The map in the Figure 8.68 shows how much
temperatures will change in different regions based on the Coupled Climate 2.1 model.
In what place is the
temperature increase the greatest? Where in the United States is the temperature increase the highest?

What Will Happen

As temperature rises, more sea ice will melt. The ﬁgure below shows how much less sea ice there may be in 2050 if
temperatures keep going up ( Figure 8.69). This would cause sea level to rise even higher. Some coastal cities could
be under water. Millions of people would have to move inland. How might other living things be affected?

FIGURE 8.68
The Arctic will experience the greatest
temperature changes.

FIGURE 8.69
In the 2050s, there may be only half as
much sea ice as there was in the 1950s.

Weather will become more extreme. Heat waves and droughts will become more frequent and more intense. The
Midwestern United States will become hot and dry. This will make growing food more difﬁcult. Cropland worldwide
will be affected. Hurricanes may become more severe.
Plants and animals will move or die out. Some will thrive in a warmer world, but most will not. The biosphere may
become quite different.
These are only a few of the impacts warmer temperatures will have. The vast majority of scientists agree that this is
what is happening.

Summary

• Global temperatures will increase. Some locations like the Arctic and Amazon will experience a greater

increase.

• Sea level will rise and some coastal cities may be submerged.
• Weather will become more extreme. Crops and some plants and animals may not be able to survive the warmer

8.32 Reducing Greenhouse Gas Pollution

• Describe how greenhouse gas pollution can be reduced.

What can the polar bear do?
Polar bears evolved to hunt from ice. As arctic ice melts, polar bears are having a harder time ﬁnding food. Polar
bears can adapt to ﬁnding food in other locations, like garbage dumps. But they can’t do anything about reducing
global warming. Humans create greenhouse gas emissions, and so humans can reduce those emissions. It’s not too
soon to get started.

Climate Regulations

The Clean Air Act of 1970 was crucial for reducing air pollution in the United States. The Clean Water Act of 1970
did the same for reducing water pollution. The Montreal Protocol was even more important in some ways. This
treaty was the ﬁrst time many countries came together to solve a problem. They created a good plan for reducing
substances that destroy the ozone layer.
A treaty similar to the Montreal Protocol is needed for regulating greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol was passed
in 1997. The Protocol focused on controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Many nations signed the protocol, but not
all. The United States, which at the time was the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, did not. The U.S. is currently
the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China. Other treaties have been worked on but there has not
been much progress. There are many people, organizations and nations that think that this is too vague and too slow.
A stricter agreement must be reached very soon. By doing nothing we are doing something—continuing to raise
greenhouse gas levels and failing to prepare for the coming environmental changes. Efforts to limit greenhouse gas
emissions are mired in politics. Meanwhile, crucial time is being lost.

Ways to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions

There are several possible ways to encourage organizations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They include cap-
and-trade systems, carbon taxes, and carbon sequestration.

• In a cap-and-trade system, each nation is given a cap on carbon dioxide emissions. This is the most carbon
dioxide the country is allowed to emit. Sometimes a nation may need to go over its cap. In that case, it can
trade with another nation that is below its cap. Below, you can see how this works ( Figure 8.70).

• Carbon taxes are taxes placed on products that produce carbon dioxide. An example of this is gasoline for
your car. The taxes encourage people to use less fossil fuel. This naturally reduces carbon dioxide emissions.
• Carbon sequestration captures carbon dioxide as it is emitted by a power plant before it enters the atmo-
sphere. The carbon dioxide is then stored in another form. Carbon is sequestered naturally by forests. Trees
take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Artiﬁcial methods of sequestering carbon underground are being
researched. This is just one of the geoengineering methods that are being researched for reducing carbon
dioxide.

FIGURE 8.70
This diagram shows how a cap-and-trade
system works.

New technologies can be developed. Renewable energy sources emit fewer or no greenhouse gases. These sources
are discussed in the chapter Natural Resources.

What You Can Do

Reducing the amount that temperatures will rise will take all nations working together. But individuals can make a
difference. What can you do? Many of the same things that you do to reduce air pollution.

• Walk, ride a bike, or take a bus.
• Turn electrical appliances off.
• Reduce consumption of products and packaging.
• Unplug cell phones and other chargers when not in use.
• Use compact ﬂuorescent light bulbs.
• Use directed lighting.
• Be aware: take shorter showers, do not use more boiling water than needed, etc.
• BE INVOLVED! Learn more about climate change. Talk with people about the problem and what they can

do. Write letters to the editor or to politicians. It’s your world and your future.

Summary

• A cap-and-trade system gives nations a cap on the greenhouse gas emissions. Those that have a higher cap

than they need can trade with a nation that needs more.

• A carbon tax taxes carbon emissions to encourage conservation.
• Carbon capture and sequestration is a geoengineering solution. This method removes excess carbon dioxide

from the atmosphere and stores it.

Summary

Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is
temporary. People in many states have the joke, "if you don’t like the weather, wait ﬁve minutes and it will change."
One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses
bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where
air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather
prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the

long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric
circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same
climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth’s
climate has changed throughout the planet’s history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has
been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades
the rate has really intensiﬁed. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The
destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and
voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the
future.

Introduction

www.ck12.org

Why don’t these mountains look the same?
The same plate tectonics processes caused both sets of mountains to rise. In both cases, two continental plates
smashed together at a convergent plate boundary. The Himalaya Mountains on the left are still uplifting. The
landscape is steep and rugged. The photo on the right shows the Appalachian Mountains. These mountains were
once steep like the Himalaya. If the only processes on Earth were plate tectonics processes, the Appalachians might
still look like the Himalaya. But the Appalachian Mountains are low and rounded. Over time the Appalachians have
undergone weathering and erosion. This chapter is about the processes that modify the landscape. These processes
alter landforms. Some of these processes create new landforms.

• Weathering breaks rocks apart or alters them.
• Erosion moves the pieces of broken rock.

Why are these rocks different?
The rock seen on the left is being mined in a quarry. What are the features of the rock? The rock seen on the right
is exposed in an outcrop. How do the features of these rocks differ? The rock in the quarry is being exposed to the
elements for the ﬁrst time. It is not weathered. The rock in the outcrop has been weathering for many thousands of
years. Can you identify the weathering features?

Weathering changes solid rock into pieces. These pieces are called sediments. Sediments are described in the
chapter Earth’s Materials and Crust. Sediments are different sizes of rock particles. Boulders are sediments; so is
gravel. At the other end, silt and clay are also sediments. Weathering may also cause the minerals at the Earth’s
surface to change form. The new minerals that form are stable at the Earth’s surface. There are two types of
weathering, mechanical and chemical. These are discussed in the next two concepts.

Weathering Takes Time

No one can watch for millions of years as mountains are built. And no one can watch as those same mountains
gradually are worn away. But imagine a new sidewalk or road. The new road is smooth and even. Over hundreds of
years, it will completely disappear. What happens to that road over one or two years? What changes would you see
( Figure 9.1)? What forces of weathering wear down that road, or rocks or mountains over time?

One bad winter can cause a road to weather. The potholes in this road
will need to be ﬁxed.

Erosion

Erosion moves sediments after they have formed. The sediments are transported away from the place where they
form. There are several agents of erosion. Flowing water moves and deposits sediments. Water erodes far more
material than any other erosional agent. Wind is important as an agent of erosion. This is especially true in arid
climates. Ice, in glaciers, can erode enormous quantities of sediments. Gravity as a force of erosion pulls material
downhill.
Many types of landforms are created by the erosion of sediments. Some are described later in this chapter.

Deposition

Sediments are deposited in an environment of deposition. This can be a sand dune, beach, lake, river bend, or a great
number of other locations. Scientists can ﬁgure out the environment of deposition of a sedimentary rock by looking
at the size of sediments and the sedimentary features in the rock.
Many types of landforms are created by the deposition of sediments. Some are described later in this chapter.

Changing Landscapes

Plate tectonics forces work to build huge mountains and other landscapes. Conversely, the forces of weathering
gradually wear down those rocks and landscapes. Together with erosion, tall mountains turn into hills and even
plains. The Appalachian Mountains along the east coast of North America were once as tall as the Himalayas.

Summary

• Weathering breaks down Earth’s materials into smaller pieces.
• Erosion transports those pieces to other locations.
• Weathering and erosion modify Earth’s surface landscapes over time.

9.2 Mechanical Weathering

• Deﬁne mechanical weathering.
• Describe the various processes of mechanical weathering.

Why is mechanical weathering so important here?
The high mountains of the Sierra Nevada are made of granite. The climate is cold. Mechanical weathering dominates
the weathering here. Can you ﬁnd signs of mechanical weathering in the photo? Can you see evidence of chemical
weathering in the photo? Why is mechanical weathering so much more important than chemical weathering here?
How is mechanical weathering altering the landscape in the high Sierra?

Mechanical Weathering

Mechanical weathering breaks rock into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are just like the bigger rock; they’re
just smaller! The rock has broken without changing its composition. The smaller pieces have the same minerals in
the same proportions. You could use the expression “a chip off the old block“ to describe mechanical weathering!
The main agents of mechanical weathering are water, ice, and wind.

Ice Wedging

Chapter 9. Surface Processes and Landforms

Rocks can break apart into smaller pieces in many ways. Ice wedging is common where water goes above and below
its freezing point ( Figure 9.2). This can happen in winter in the mid-latitudes or in colder climates in summer. Ice
wedging is common in mountainous regions like the Sierra Nevada pictured above.

FIGURE 9.2
Diagram showing ice wedging.

This is how ice wedging works. When liquid water changes into solid ice, it increases in volume. You see this when
you ﬁll an ice cube tray with water and put it in the freezer. The ice cubes go to a higher level in the tray than the
water. You also may have seen this if you put a can of soda into the freezer so that it cools down quickly. If you
leave the can in the freezer too long, the liquid expands so much that it bends or pops the can. (For the record, water
is very unusual. Most substances get smaller when they change from a liquid to a solid.)
Ice wedging happens because water expands as it goes from liquid to solid. When the temperature is warm, water
works its way into cracks in rock. When the temperature cools below freezing, the water turns to ice and expands.
The ice takes up more space. Over time, this wedges the rock apart. Ice wedging is very effective at weathering.
You can ﬁnd large piles of broken rock at the base of a slope. These rocks were broken up by ice wedging. Once
loose, they tumbled down the slope.

Abrasion

Abrasion is another type of mechanical weathering. With abrasion, one rock bumps against another rock. Gravity
causes abrasion as a rock tumbles down a slope. Moving water causes abrasion; it moves rocks so that they bump
against one another ( Figure 9.3). Strong winds cause abrasion by blasting sand against rock surfaces. Finally, the
ice in glaciers cause abrasion. Pieces of rock embedded in ice at the bottom of a glacier scrape against the rock
below. If you have ever collected beach glass or pebbles from a stream, you have witnessed the work of abrasion.

FIGURE 9.3
Water ﬂowing through river or beach cobbles causes them to hit each
other. This contact causes abrasion, which makes the rocks round.

Plants and Animals in Mechanical Weathering

Sometimes plants or animals cause mechanical weathering. This can happen slowly. A plant’s roots grow into a
crack in rock. As the roots grow larger, they wedge open the crack ( Figure 9.4). Burrowing animals can also cause

657

9.2. Mechanical Weathering

www.ck12.org

weathering. By digging for food or creating a hole to live, in the animal may break apart rock.

FIGURE 9.4
The large roots of this tree can break apart rock. This is mechanical
weathering.

Humans and Mechanical Weathering

Today, human beings do a lot of mechanical weathering whenever we dig or blast into rock. This is common when
we build homes, roads, and subways, or quarry stone for construction or other uses.

Summary

• Mechanical weathering breaks down existing rocks and minerals.
• Mechanical weathering keeps the chemical makeup of materials the same.
• Ice wedging, abrasion, and some actions of living organisms and humans bring about mechanical weathering.

9.3 Chemical Weathering

• Deﬁne chemical weathering.
• Describe the various processes of chemical weathering.

Why is the rock different colors on the surface and in the interior?
This rock is at South Mountain Park in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The climate is often hot and arid. What colors
are the rock in this photo? What color is the surface of the rock? What color is the interior? Why do you think there
are differences in color between the surface and the interior of this rock? How is chemical weathering altering the
landscape?

Chemical Weathering

Chemical weathering is different than mechanical weathering. The minerals in the rock change their chemical
makeup. They become a different type of mineral or even a different type of rock. Chemical weathering works
through chemical reactions that change the rock.

No Longer Stable

Most minerals form deep within Earth’s crust. At these depths, temperatures and pressures are much higher than
at the surface. Minerals that were stable deeper in the crust are not stable under surface conditions. That’s why
chemical weathering happens. Minerals that formed at higher temperature and pressure change into minerals that
are stable at the surface.

659

9.3. Chemical Weathering

Agents of Chemical Weathering

www.ck12.org

There are many agents of chemical weathering. Remember that water was a main agent of mechanical weathering.
Well, water is also an agent of chemical weathering. That makes it a double agent! Carbon dioxide and oxygen are
also agents of chemical weathering. Each of these is discussed below.

Water

Water is an amazing molecule. It has a very simple chemical formula, H2O. It is made of just two hydrogen atoms
bonded to one oxygen atom. Water is remarkable in terms of all the things it can do. Lots of things dissolve easily
in water. Some types of rock can even completely dissolve in water ( Figure 9.5)! Other minerals change by adding
water into their structure. Hydrolysis is the name of the chemical reaction between a compound and water.

FIGURE 9.5
Weathered rock in Walnut Canyon near Flagstaff, Arizona.

Carbon Dioxide

Carbon dioxide (CO2) combines with water as raindrops fall through the air. This makes a weak acid, called carbonic
acid. This happens so often that carbonic acid is a common, weak acid found in nature. This acid works to dissolve
rock. It eats away at sculptures and monuments. While this is normal, more acids are made when we add pollutants
to the air. Any time we burn any fossil fuel, it adds nitrous oxide to the air. When we burn coal, rich in sulfur, it adds
sulfur dioxide to the air. As nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide react with water, they form nitric acid and sulfuric acid.
These are the two main components of acid rain. Acid rain accelerates chemical weathering.

Oxygen

Oxygen strongly reacts with elements at the Earth’s surface. This process is called oxidation. You are probably
most familiar with the rust that forms when iron reacts with oxygen. Many minerals are rich in iron. Red rocks are
full of iron oxides ( Figure 9.6). As iron changes into iron oxide, the iron oxides can also make red color in soils.

Plants and Animals

Plants and animals also cause chemical weathering. As plant roots take in nutrients, they remove elements from the
minerals. This causes a chemical change in the rock.

Mechanical Weathering and Chemical Weathering

Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering. As rock breaks into smaller pieces, the surface
area of the pieces increases. With more surfaces exposed, there are more places for chemical weathering to occur (
Figure 9.7). Let’s say you wanted to make some hot chocolate on a cold day. It would be hard to get a big chunk of

chocolate to dissolve in your milk or hot water. Maybe you could make hot chocolate from some smaller pieces like
chocolate chips, but it is much easier to add a powder to your milk. This is because the smaller the pieces are, the
more surface area they have. Smaller pieces dissolve more easily.

FIGURE 9.7
Mechanical weathering may increase the
rate of chemical weathering.

• Chemical weathering changes the composition of a mineral to break it down.
• Water chemically weathers rock in hydrolysis.

9.4 Inﬂuences on Weathering

• Learn how different factors inﬂuence weathering.

How is weathering different in these two places?
Weathering varies for a lot of reasons. If you compare these two photos, one reason stands out. On the left, there is a
lot of plant life. On the right, not so much. Why is the amount of plant life so different? The left is a rainforest, with
a warm and wet climate. The right is a desert, with a warm and dry climate. Climate is very important for causing
weathering. The way a landscape is modiﬁed depends on the climate of the region and other factors.

Rock and Mineral Type

Some types of minerals weather easily. Some types of minerals are very resistant to weathering. Some minerals in
a rock might completely dissolve in water. This leaves behind the more resistant minerals, which are released from
the rock. A beautiful example of this effect is the "Stone Forest" in China, shown in the video below:

• Stone Forest at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln5K3_8Cxrc (3:18)

MEDIA

URL: http://www.ck12.org/ﬂx/render/embeddedobject/4779

Rocks also weather differently. Igneous rocks are usually solid and are more resistant to weathering. Intrusive
igneous rocks weather slowly because it is hard for water to penetrate them. Sedimentary rocks usually weather
more easily. For example, limestone dissolves in weak acids like rainwater.
Different types of sedimentary rocks can weather differently. This will lead to differential erosion. In the photo of
the Grand Canyon, some layers create cliffs. These are hard rocks that do not weather easily. Rock layers that resist
weathering and erosion form the top of the canyon and the top of features. Softer layers form slopes. These are
rocks that weather more easily ( Figure 9.8).

FIGURE 9.8
The rocks in this photo of
the Grand
Canyon are all sedimentary. Hard rocks
that are resistant to weathering form cliffs.
Softer rocks that weather more easily
form slopes.

Climate

Climate is the temperature plus precipitation of an area. Not just today, but over a long period of time. Climate
affects chemical weathering. Chemical weathering increases as:

• Temperature increases. Chemical reactions are faster at higher temperatures.
• Precipitation increases. Chemical reactions increase when there is more water. Since water increases both

mechanical and chemical weathering, more water strongly increases weathering.

Look at how temperature and precipitation change weathering. What type of climate has the lowest weathering rate?
A cold, dry climate. A warm, wet climate has the highest weathering rate.

Vegetation

Plants increase mechanical and chemical weathering. Plant roots may enter cracks in rock and break it apart. Plant
debris may increase the amount of acid in water. The warmer and wetter a climate is, the more plants it will have.
Bacteria also grow more in warm, wet regions. So, warm, wet climates have more weathering from biological
processes.

Resources from Weathering

In tropical climates, chemical weathering can be intense. Some
Weathering may concentrate some resources.
minerals dissolve and water carries them away. This leaves behind the materials that are not soluble. Bauxite is
aluminum oxide that collects this way. Bauxite is our main source of aluminum ore.

Summary

• Different minerals and rocks weather at different rates under the same conditions.
• Different temperature and precipitation will cause the same materials to weather differently.
• Vegetation increases weathering, both mechanical and chemical.

9.5. Soil Characteristics

9.5 Soil Characteristics

• Describe the characteristics of soil.

How does soil resemble weathered rock?
The same processes that weather rock create soil. A large part of soil is weathered rock! If weathering processes
didn’t exist on earth we would have no soil. Earth wouldn’t be a very good place to live. There would be very limited
plant life and not much way to grow crops.

The Importance of Soil

You learned in the previous concept that weathering produces sediment. Weathering also produces soil.
People could not live on earth without soil! Your life and the lives of many land organisms depend on soil. Soil is
only a very thin layer over solid rock. Yet, it is the place where reactions between solid rock, liquid water and air take
place. Soil anchors plant roots and provides them with water and nutrients. We get wood, paper, cotton, medicines,
and even pure water from soil. So soil is a very important resource. Our precious soil needs to be carefully managed
and cared for. If we don’t take care of the soil we have, we may not be able to use it in the future.

Characteristics of Soil

Soil is a complex mixture of different materials.

• Some of them are inorganic. Inorganic materials are made from non-living substances like pebbles and sand.
• Soil also contains bits of organic materials from plants and animals.

In general, about half of the soil is made of pieces of rock and minerals. The other half is organic materials.
In some soils, the organic portion is entirely missing. This is true of desert sand. At the other extreme, a soil may be
completely organic. Peat, found in a bog or swamp, is totally organic soil. Organic materials are necessary for a soil
to be fertile. The organic portion provides the nutrients needed for strong plant growth.

666

www.ck12.org

Soil Texture

Chapter 9. Surface Processes and Landforms

The inorganic portion of soil is made of many different size particles. These different size particles are present in
different proportions. The sizes and proportions of particles determines some of the properties of the soil.

• Water can ﬂow easily through a permeable soil. Spaces between the inorganic particles are large and well

connected. Sandy or silty soils are permeable, water-draining types of soils.

• Soils with lots of very small spaces are water-holding soils. When clay is present in a soil, the soil holds

together more tightly. Clay-rich soil can hold more water.

• When a soil contains a mixture of grain sizes, the soil is called a loam ( Figure 9.9).

FIGURE 9.9
Two layers of soil are shown here. A sandy soil is at the bottom. A soil
with more clay is at the top.

Classiﬁcation

Soil scientists classify soil by measuring the percentage of sand, silt, and clay. They plot this information on a
triangular diagram. Each size particle is at one corner ( Figure 9.10). The soil type is then known from the location
on the diagram. At the top, a soil would be clay; at the left corner, it would be sand; at the right corner, it would be
silt. Soils in the lower middle with less than 50% clay are loams.

Soil, the Ecosystem

We can think about soil as a living resource. Soil is an ecosystem all by itself! In the spaces of soil are millions of
living organisms. These include earthworms, ants, bacteria, and fungi. ( Figure 9.11).

Summary

• Soil reﬂects the interactions between the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.
• Permeable soils allow water to ﬂow through.
• The proportions of silt, clay, and sand allow scientists to classify soil type.

activity.

How are these two soils different?
What color is the soil on the left? What color is the soil on the right? Why do you think they differ so much in color?
Which soil do you think is better for growing things? See below to ﬁnd out!

Soil Formation

How well soil forms and what type of soil forms depends on several different factors, which are described below.

• An animation of how weathering makes soil is found here: http://courses.soil.ncsu.edu/resources/soil_classiﬁ

cation_genesis/mineral_weathering/mineral_weathering.swf .

Soil development takes a very long time. It may take hundreds or even thousands of years to form the fertile upper
layer of soil. Soil scientists estimate that in the very best soil forming conditions, soil forms at a rate of about
1mm/year. In poor conditions, it may take thousands of years!

Weathering

Soil formation requires weathering. Where there is less weathering, soils are thinner. However, soluble minerals
may be present. Where there is intense weathering, soils may be thick. Minerals and nutrients would have been
washed out.

Climate

Climate is the most important factor determining soil type. Given enough time, a climate will produce a particular
type of soil. The original rock type does not matter. Two rocks of the same type will form a different soil type in
each different climate. This is true because most rocks on Earth are made of the same eight elements. When the rock
breaks down to become soil, the soil is the same.
The same climate factors that lead to high weathering also produce more soil.

670

www.ck12.org

Chapter 9. Surface Processes and Landforms

• More rain weathers minerals and rocks more. Rain allows chemical reactions especially in the top layers of

the soil.

• More rain can dissolve more rock. More rain can carry away more material. As material is carried away, new

surfaces are exposed. This also increases the rate of weathering.

• Higher temperatures increase the rate of chemical reactions. This also increases soil formation.
• In warmer regions, plants and bacteria grow faster. Plants and animals weather material and produce soils.
In tropical regions, where temperature and precipitation are consistently high, thick soils form. Arid regions
have thin soils.

Soil type also inﬂuences the type of vegetation that can grow in the region. We can identify climate types by the
types of plants that grow there.

Parent Rock

The original rock is the source of the inorganic portion of the soil. Mechanical weathering breaks rock into smaller
pieces. Chemical reactions change the rock’s minerals.
Soil may form in place or from material that has been moved.

• Residual soil forms in place. The underlying rock breaks down to form the layers of soil above it. Only about

one-third of the soils in the United States are residual.

• Transported soil has come in from somewhere else. Sediments can be transported into an area by glaciers,

wind, water, or gravity. Soils form from the loose particles that have been transported and deposited.

Slope

Weathered material washes off steep slopes and so does not stay in place to form soil. Soil forms where land areas
are ﬂat or gently undulating.

Time

Soils thicken as the amount of time available for weathering increases. The longer the amount of time that soil
remains in a particular area, the thicker it will be.

Biological Activity

Biological activity produces the organic material in soil. Humus forms from the remains of plants and animals. It
is an extremely important part of the soil. Humus coats the mineral grains. It binds them together into clumps that
hold the soil together. This gives the soil its structure. Soils with high humus are better able to hold water. Soils rich
with organic materials hold nutrients better and are more fertile. These soils are more easily farmed.
The color of soil indicates its fertility. Black or dark brown soils are rich in nitrogen and contain a high percentage
of organic materials. Soils that are nitrogen poor and low in organic material might be gray, yellow, or red ( Figure
9.12). Soil with low organic material is not good for growing plants.

Summary

• Many factors affect soil formation. Some are climate, rock type, slope, time, and biological activity. Differ-

ences in these factors may produce different types of soil.

• Soil type determines what can grow in a region.
• Humus is the decayed remains of living organisms. Humus makes soil fertile.

Soil Horizons and Proﬁles

Soil develops over time and forms soil horizons. Soil horizons are different layers of soil with depth. The most
weathering occurs in the top layer. This layer is most exposed to weather! It is where fresh water comes into contact
with the soil. Each layer lower is weathered just a little bit less than the layer above. As water moves down through
the layers, it is able to do less work to change the soil. This is because the chemical reactions have already occurred.
If you dig a deep hole in the ground, you may see each of the different layers of soil. All together, the layers are
a soil proﬁle. Each horizon has its own set of characteristics ( Figure 9.13). In the simplest soil proﬁle, a soil has
three horizons.

Topsoil

The ﬁrst horizon is the “A“ horizon. It is more commonly called the topsoil. The topsoil is usually the darkest layer
of the soil. It is the layer with the most organic material. Humus forms from all the plant and animal debris that
falls to or grows on the ground. The topsoil is also the region with the most biological activity. Many organisms
live within this layer. Plant roots stretch down into this layer. The roots help to hold the topsoil in place. Topsoil is
needed to grow most crops ( Figure 9.14).

FIGURE 9.13
In this diagram, a cut through soil shows different soil layers.

FIGURE 9.14
Good topsoil is great for growing plants.

Topsoil usually does not have very small particles like clay. Clay-sized particles are carried to lower layers as water
seeps down into the ground. Many minerals dissolve in the fresh water that moves through the topsoil. These
minerals are carried down to the lower layers of soil.

Subsoil

Below the topsoil is the “B“ horizon. This is also called the subsoil. Soluble minerals and clays accumulate in the
subsoil. Because it has less organic material, this layer is lighter brown in color than topsoil. It also holds more
water due to the presence of iron and clay. There is less organic material in this layer.

C-horizon

The next layer down is the “C” horizon. The C horizon is made of partially altered bedrock. There is evidence of
weathering in this layer. Still, it is possible to identify the original rock type from which this soil formed ( Figure
9.15).
Not all climate regions develop soils. Arid regions are poor at soil development. Not all regions develop the same
soil horizons. Some areas develop as many as ﬁve or six distinct layers. Others develop only a few.

9.8 Types of Soils

• Describe the characteristics of types of soil.
• Describe where each type of soil is found.

Where would you rather grow crops?
The soil on the left is in Tuscany in Italy. Tuscany is best known for growing grapes for wine and olives for olive
oil. The soil on the right is in China. It is the soil that remained when rainforest trees were removed. Do you know
which soil would be better for crops?

Types of Soils

For soil scientists, there are thousands of types of soil! Soil scientists put soils into very speciﬁc groups with certain
characteristics. Each soil type has its own name. Let’s consider a much simpler model, with just three types of soil.
These types are based on climate. Just remember that there are many more than just these three types.

Pedalfer

One important type of soil forms in a deciduous forest.
In these forests, trees lose their leaves each winter.
Deciduous trees need lots of rain —at least 65 cm of rainfall per year. Deciduous forests are common in the
temperate, eastern United States. The type of soil found in a deciduous forest is a pedalfer ( Figure 9.16). This type
of soil is usually dark brown or black in color and very fertile.

Pedocal

Pedocal soil forms where grasses and brush are common ( Figure 9.17). The climate is drier, with less than 65 cm
of rain per year. With less rain, there is less chemical weathering, there is less organic material, and the soils are
slightly less fertile.

Laterite

A third important type of soil is laterite. Laterite forms in tropical areas. Temperatures are warm and rain falls every
day ( Figure 9.18). So much rain falls that chemical weathering is intense. All soluble minerals are washed from
the soil. Plant nutrients get carried away. There is practically no humus. Laterite soils are often red in color from the
iron oxides. If laterites are exposed to the Sun, they bake as hard as a brick.

The soil beneath a deciduous forest is a pedalfer. These soils are very
fertile.

FIGURE 9.17
Grassland soils are less rich than soils in more humid regions.

FIGURE 9.18
Laterite soils, which are found beneath rainforests, are not good for
growing crops.

Summary

• Pedalfer is the soil common in deciduous forests. Pedalfer is dark brown and fertile.
• Pedocal is the soil common in grasslands. The more arid climate increases calcium in the soil. Pedocal is not

as fertile.

• Laterite forms in tropical rain forests. Chemical weathering strips the soils of their nutrients. When the forest

is removed the soil is not very fertile.

9.9 Soil Erosion

• Explain how human activities cause soil erosion.

Could it happen again?
Farmers were forced off their lands during the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The rains stopped, and the topsoil blew off
these former grasslands. This scene was repeated throughout the central United States. During long droughts, some
people wonder if another dust bowl could come.

Causes of Soil Erosion

The same agents that erode landscapes also erode soil. They are water, wind, ice, or gravity. Running water is the
leading cause of soil erosion. Water is abundant and has a lot of power. Wind is also a leading cause of soil erosion.
Wind can pick up soil and blow it far away.
Activities that remove vegetation, disturb the ground, or allow the ground to dry are activities that increase erosion.
What are some human activities that increase soil erosion?

680

www.ck12.org

Farming

Chapter 9. Surface Processes and Landforms

The photos below ( Figure 9.19) show how farming practices can increase soil erosion. Plant roots penetrate the soil
and keep it from eroding. Plowing turns over bare soil and cuts through plant roots. Bare soil is exposed to wind and
water. In the past, farmers always plowed ﬁelds before planting.
The problem doesn’t stop with plowing. Crops are usually planted in rows with bare soil in between the rows. In
places where crops grow only during part of the year, the land may be bare for a few months.

FIGURE 9.19
Farming leaves some soil exposed to ero-
sion.

The soil that is most likely to erode is the nutrient-rich topsoil. The loss of topsoil degrades the farmland.

Grazing

As pictured below ( Figure 9.20), some grazing animals, especially sheep and goats, eat grass right down to the
roots. They may even pull the grass entirely out of the ground. Grazing animals can kill the grass. They may thin
it out so much that it offers little protection to the soil. If animals are kept in the same place too long, the soil may
become completely bare. The bare soil is easily eroded by wind and water.

Logging, Mining and Construction

Other human actions that put soil at risk include logging, mining, and construction. You can see examples of each
below ( Figure 9.21).

• When forests are cut down, the soil is suddenly exposed to wind and rain. Without trees, there is no leaf litter

to cover the ground and protect the soil. When leaf litter decays, it adds humus and nutrients to the soil.

681

9.9. Soil Erosion

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 9.20
Sheep and goats can damage plants and leave the soil bare.

• Mining and construction strip soil off the ground and leave the land bare.
• Paved roads and parking lots prevent rainwater from soaking into the ground. This increases runoff and the

potential for soil erosion.

FIGURE 9.21
Logging, mining, construction, and paving
surfaces are some of the ways that soil
erosion increases.

Recreation

Even things that people do for fun can expose soil to erosion. For example, overuse of hiking trails can leave bare
patches of soil. Off-road vehicles cause even more damage; examples of this are pictured below ( Figure 9.22).
Soil erosion is a natural occurrence. However, human activities have greatly accelerated soil erosion.
In some
locations, soil may now be eroding about 10 times faster than its natural rate. Since Europeans settled in the United
States, approximately one-third of the topsoil has eroded away.

Chapter 9. Surface Processes and Landforms

FIGURE 9.22
What’s fun for people may be bad for soil.
Off-road vehicles can destroy plants and
leave the ground bare. This sets up the
soil for erosion.

Summary

• Soil erosion is a natural process, but human activities can increase it.
• The main agents of soil erosion are water and wind.
• Soil erosion is more likely where the ground has been disturbed. Farming, grazing animals, logging, mining,

construction, and recreational activities can do this.

9.10 Avoiding Soil Loss

• Describe steps that can be taken to minimize soil loss.

Why did someone cut designs into this hillside?
Although the hillside is interesting, that’s not why this was done. Terracing prevents soil erosion on a hillside that is
being farmed. Many techniques can be utilized to reduce soil erosion.

Preventing Soil Erosion

Soil is a renewable resource, but it can take thousands of years to form. That’s why people need to do what they can
to prevent soil erosion.

Farming Methods that Reduce Soil Erosion

The Dust Bowl taught people that soil could be lost by plowing and growing crops. New ways of farming were
developed to protect the soil. Some of the methods are described below ( Figure 9.23).

Other Ways to Reduce Soil Erosion

There are several other ways to help prevent soil loss. Some of them are pictured below ( Figure 9.24).

• Prevent overgrazing. Frequently move animals from ﬁeld to ﬁeld. This gives the grass a chance to recover.

685

9.10. Avoiding Soil Loss

FIGURE 9.23
There are many farming methods that help prevent soil erosion.

• Avoid logging steep hillsides. Cut only a few trees in any given place. Plant new trees to replace those that

are cut down.

• Reclaim mine lands. Save the stripped topsoil and return it to the land. Once the soil is in place, plant trees

and other plants to protect the bare soil.

• Use barriers to prevent runoff and soil erosion at construction sites. Plant grass to hold the soil in place.
• Develop paving materials that absorb water and reduce runoff.
• Restrict the use of off-road vehicles, especially in hilly areas.

9.11 Erosion by Streams

• Describe different types of stream erosion.

What’s different about these landscapes?
Both of these rivers run through Yellowstone National Park. The Firehole River is a tributary of the Madison. In this
photo, it’s ﬂowing over ﬂat ground. The Yellowstone River on the right is cascading over Yellowstone Falls. Which
river is doing more erosion? In what direction is the stream eroding?

Erosion by Surface Water

Water that ﬂows over Earth’s surface includes runoff, streams, and rivers. All these types of ﬂowing water can cause
erosion and deposition.

Erosion by Runoff

When a lot of rain falls in a short period of time, much of the water is unable to soak into the ground. Instead, it
runs over the land. Gravity causes the water to ﬂow from higher to lower ground. As the runoff ﬂows, it may pick
up loose bits of soil and sand.
Runoff causes more erosion if the land is bare. Plants help hold the soil in place. The runoff water pictured below (
Figure 9.25) is brown because it eroded soil from a bare, sloping ﬁeld. Can you ﬁnd evidence of erosion by runoff
where you live? What should you look for?
Much of the material eroded by runoff is carried into bodies of water, such as streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, or oceans.
Runoff is an important cause of erosion. That’s because it occurs over so much of Earth’s surface.

Erosion by Streams

Streams erode sediment from their banks. They pick up and transport sediments.

channels

FIGURE 9.26
A stream in the desert rushes past its
banks. The power of the water erodes the
cliff face.

As a stream erodes its banks, it creates a V-shaped valley ( Figure 9.26). This contrasts with the U-shaped valleys
created by glaciers.

Erosion and Water Speed

Erosion by a stream depends on the velocity of the water. Fast water erodes more material than slow water.
Eventually, the water deposits the materials. As water slows, larger particles are deposited ﬁrst. As the water slows
even more, smaller particles are deposited. The graph pictured below ( Figure 9.27) shows how water velocity and
particle size inﬂuence erosion and deposition.

Chapter 9. Surface Processes and Landforms

FIGURE 9.27
Flowing water erodes or deposits parti-
cles depending on how fast the water is
moving.
It also depends on how big the
particles are.

Erosion in the Mountains

Streams often start in mountains, where the land is very steep ( Figure 9.28). A mountain stream ﬂows very quickly
because of the steep slope. This causes a lot of erosion and very little deposition. The rapidly falling water digs
down into the stream bed and makes it deeper. It carves a narrow, V-shaped channel.

FIGURE 9.28
This mountain stream is in Whitney Portal
in the Sierra Nevada of
California. The slope is so steep that water cascades down in a waterfall.

691

9.11. Erosion by Streams

How a Waterfall Forms

www.ck12.org

Mountain streams may erode waterfalls. A waterfall forms where a stream ﬂows from an area of harder to softer
rock ( Figure 9.29). The water erodes the softer rock faster than the harder rock. This causes the stream bed to drop
down, like a step. This creates a waterfall. As erosion continues, the waterfall gradually moves upstream.

FIGURE 9.29
How a waterfall forms and moves. Why
does a waterfall keep moving upstream?

Erosion by Slow-Flowing Rivers

Streams eventually run onto ﬂatter ground. Rivers ﬂowing over gentle slopes erode the sides of their channels more
than the bottom. Large curves, called meanders, form because of erosion and deposition by the moving water. The
curves are called meanders because they slowly “wander,” or meander, over the land. Below, you can see how this
happens ( Figure 9.30).
As meanders erode from side to side, they create a ﬂoodplain. This is a broad, ﬂat area on both sides of a river.
Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake ( Figure 9.31).

Summary

• Faster water carries more and larger sediment.
• Streams erode their banks to create V-shaped valleys.
• A river on ﬂat ground meanders. When a meander is cut off it may become an oxbow lake.
• A ﬂoodplain is where the extra water goes when the river is in ﬂood.

Sediment Transport

The size of particles determines how they are carried by ﬂowing water; this is illustrated below ( Figure 9.32).

FIGURE 9.32
How Flowing Water Moves Particles. How
particles are moved by ﬂowing water de-
pends on their size.

Sediments are carried as:

695

9.12. Deposition by Streams

www.ck12.org

• Dissolved load: Dissolved ions are carried in the water. These ions usually travel all the way to the ocean.
• Suspended load: Sediments carried as solids as the stream ﬂows are suspended load. The size of particles

that can be carried is determined by the stream’s velocity ( Figure 9.33).

FIGURE 9.33

Sound.

it carries.

• Bed load: Some particles are too large to be carried as suspended load. These sediments are bumped and
pushed along the stream bed as bed load. Bed load sediments do not move continuously. This intermittent
movement is called saltation. Streams with high velocities that ﬂow down steep slopes cut down into the
stream bed. The sediments that travel as bed load do a lot of the downcutting.

• An animation of saltation is found here: http://www.weru.ksu.edu/new_weru/multimedia/movies/dust003.m

pg .

• A video of bedload transport is found here: http://faculty.gg.uwyo.edu/heller/SedMovs/Sed%20Movie%20ﬁle

s/bdld.mov .

Deposition by Streams and Rivers

When a stream or river slows down, it starts dropping its sediments. Larger sediments are dropped in steep areas,
but smaller sediments can still be carried. Smaller sediments are dropped as the slope becomes less steep.

Alluvial Fans

In arid regions, a mountain stream may ﬂow onto ﬂatter land. The stream comes to a stop rapidly. The deposits form
an alluvial fan ( Figure 9.34).

Deltas

Deposition also occurs when a stream or river empties into a large body of still water. In this case, a delta forms. A
delta is shaped like a triangle. It spreads out into the body of water. An example is pictured below ( Figure 9.34).

696

www.ck12.org

Chapter 9. Surface Processes and Landforms

FIGURE 9.34
(A) Alluvial fans in Death Valley, California
(B) Nile River Delta in Egypt

Deposition by Flood Waters

A ﬂood occurs when a river overﬂows it banks. This might happen because of heavy rains.

Floodplains

As the water spreads out over the land, it slows down and drops its sediment. If a river ﬂoods often, the ﬂoodplain
develops a thick layer of rich soil because of all the deposits. That’s why ﬂoodplains are usually good places for
growing plants. For example, the Nile River in Egypt provides both water and thick sediments for raising crops in
the middle of a sandy desert.

Natural Levees

A ﬂooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee ( Figure 9.35) is a raised strip of sediments
deposited close to the water’s edge. Levees occur because ﬂoodwaters deposit their biggest sediments ﬁrst when
they overﬂow the river’s banks.

Summary

• Streams carry dissolved ions and sediments. The sizes of the sediments a stream can carry, its competence,

depend on the stream’s velocity.

• Particles that are too large to be suspended move along the stream bed by saltation.
• Rivers deposit sediments on levees, ﬂoodplains, and in deltas and alluvial fans.

Fresh water is found in cenotes, sinkholes that are common in the Yucatan limestone.

Groundwater Erosion

It travels down through tiny holes in soil.

Some water soaks into the ground.
It seeps through cracks in rock.
The water moves slowly, pulled deeper and deeper by gravity. Water in an underground rock or sediment layer is
groundwater. Underground water can also erode and deposit material.
Rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) as it falls. The CO2 combines with water to form carbonic acid. The slightly
acidic water is especially good at dissolving the rock limestone. Groundwater creates landforms by dissolving away
rock.
Florida is unique for groundwater erosion. The state is extremely ﬂat and is made mostly of limestone. Due to
the wet climate, groundwater surfaces in many locations. In the Everglades, rivers create a wide ﬂoodplain and
groundwater comes to the surface ( Figure 9.36).

Caves

www.ck12.org

Caves are one of the types of landforms created by groundwater erosion. Working slowly over many years, ground-
water travels along small cracks. The water dissolves and carries away the solid rock. This gradually enlarges the
cracks. Eventually, a cave, like the one pictured in the Figure 9.37, may form.

FIGURE 9.37
Water ﬂows through a limestone cave.

You can explore a fantastic cave, Kartchner Caverns, in Arizona, by watching this video: http://video.nationalgeo
graphic.com/video/player/science/earth-sci/exploring-kartchner-sci.html .

Sinkholes

As erosion by groundwater continues, the ceiling of a cave may collapse. The rock and soil above it sink into the
ground. This forms a sinkhole on the surface. Some sinkholes are large enough to swallow up a home or several
homes in a neighborhood.

• Describe how groundwater deposits solid materials.
• Describe the features that groundwater deposits.

Where would you look for a spectacular cave like this one?
Groundwater dissolves minerals and rocks into ions. Groundwater deposits those ions into different types of
structures. Limestone caves are the best place to see these structures. Water erodes the cave and it has deposits
structures like stalactites and stalagmites. The cave pictured here is Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico.

Cave Deposits

Caves are known for their spectacular mineral structures. Caves are likely to be found in limestone where the
groundwater level has gone down. This exposes the cave and its features. Stalactites are beautiful icicle-like
formations. They form as water containing calcium carbonate drips from the ceiling of a cave. The word "stalactite"
has a "c," and it forms from the ceiling. Stalagmites form as calcium carbonate drips from the ceiling to the ﬂoor of

of both stalactites and stalagmites below ( Figure 9.38).
If a stalactite and stalagmite join together, they form a column. One of the wonders of visiting a cave is to witness

9.15 Erosion by Waves

• Learn how waves cause erosion.
• Describe the landforms caused by wave erosion.

Is this erosion or deposition?
The power of the ocean modiﬁes landforms by erosion and deposition. Landforms modiﬁed by both erosion and
deposition are seen in this photo. The cliff is being eroded by incoming waves. The beach is being created as sand
is being deposited.

Wave Erosion

Wave energy does the work of erosion at the shore. Waves erode sediments from cliffs and shorelines. The sediment
in ocean water acts like sandpaper. Over time, they erode the shore. The bigger the waves are and the more sediment
they carry, the more erosion they cause ( Figure 9.39).
Wave refraction either concentrates wave energy or disperses it. In quiet water areas, such as bays, wave energy is
dispersed. This allows sand to be deposited. Land that sticks out into the water is eroded by the strong wave energy.
The wave energy concentrates its power on the wave-cut cliff.

Landforms From Wave Erosion

Erosion by waves can create unique landforms ( Figure 9.40).

• Wave-cut cliffs form when waves erode a rocky shoreline. They create a vertical wall of exposed rock layers.

705

9.15. Erosion by Waves

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 9.39
Waves erode sediment from sea cliffs. The sediment is then deposited on
beaches. These sandy cliffs are in Greece.

• Wave-cut platforms are level areas formed by wave erosion. Since these platforms are above sea level, it

means that either sea level was higher relative or the rock was lower.

FIGURE 9.40
A wave-cut platform is exposed in Pembrokeshire, South Wales.

• Sea arches form when waves erode both sides of a cliff. They create a hole in the cliff, like the one pictured

below ( Figure 9.41).

FIGURE 9.41
A sea arch creates a natural bridge in California.

• Sea stacks form when waves erode the top of a sea arch. This leaves behind pillars of rock.

Sediment Transport

Rivers carry sediments from the land to the sea. Sometimes the sediments are deposited in a delta. But if the waves
are powerful, the water will transport the sediments along the coastline. Sediments eroded from cliffs near the
shoreline may also be transported.

Wave Refraction

Most waves approach the shore at an angle. The part of the wave that is nearer the shore reaches shallow water
sooner than the part that is farther out. The shallow part of the wave "feels" the bottom ﬁrst. This slows down the
inshore part of the wave and makes the wave "bend." This bending is called refraction.

• In this animation, notice how the wave refracts as it comes into the beach. http://www.grossmont.edu/garyjac

obson/Oceanography%20112/Wave%20Model.htm

Most waves strike the shore at an angle. This creates longshore currents, which are described in the concept "Surface
Ocean Currents."

Summary

• Ocean waves have a tremendous amount of energy and so they may do a great deal of erosion.
• Some landforms created by erosion are platforms, arches, and sea stacks.
• Longshore currents are created because water approaches the shore at an angle.

9.16 Deposition by Waves

• Waves and currents carry sediment that they deposit on the shore.
• Describe the landforms created by sediment deposition at the shore.

Which came ﬁrst: erosion or deposition?
Both erosion and deposition are seen in this photo. The beach sands were deposited but waves are now eroding them
away. At the shore, there’s always a battle between the two types of forces. What happens when deposition is greater
than erosion? What happens when erosion is greater than deposition?

Wave Deposition

The transport of sediments by longshore currents is called longshore drift. Longshore drift is created in this way:
Sediment is moved up the beach by an incoming wave. The wave approaches at an angle to the shore. Water then
moves straight offshore. The sediment moves straight down the beach with it. The sediment is again picked up by
a wave that is coming in at an angle. So longshore drift moves sediment along the shore. This zig-zag motion is
pictured below ( Figure 9.42) and can also be seen at the link below.

Chapter 9. Surface Processes and Landforms

FIGURE 9.42
Longshore drift carries particles of sand
and rock down a coastline.

Landforms Deposited by Waves

Longshore drift continually moves sand along the shore. Deposition occurs where the water motion slows. The
smallest particles, such as silt and clay, are deposited away from shore. This is where the water is calmer. Larger
particles are deposited onshore. This is where waves and other motions are strongest.
In relatively quiet areas along a shore, waves deposit sand. Sand forms a beach ( Figure 9.43).

FIGURE 9.43
Manhattan Beach in Southern California has a pier coming off of a sandy
beach.

Waves also move sand from the beaches on shore to bars of sand offshore as the seasons change. In the summer,
waves have lower energy so they bring sand up onto the beach. In the winter, higher energy waves bring the sand
back offshore.

FIGURE 9.44
Examples of features formed by wave-
deposited sand.

A spit is a ridge of sand that extends away from the shore. The end of the spit may hook around toward the quieter
waters close to shore.

Waves may also deposit sediments to form sandbars and barrier islands. Pictured below are examples of these
landforms ( Figure 9.45); also, an example of all the different landforms waves create ( Figure 9.44).

FIGURE 9.45
A barrier island is a long strip of sand. The sand naturally moves in the
local currents. People try to build on barrier islands.

In its natural state, a barrier island acts as the ﬁrst line of defense against storms such as hurricanes. A natural barrier
island is a vegetated sandy areas in which sand can move. When barrier islands are developed, hurricanes damage
houses and businesses. A large hurricane brings massive problems to the urbanized area.

Summary

• The shore may have a lot of sediment washed from land or eroded from cliffs. The sediment is transported by

currents.

• Transported sand will eventually be deposited on beaches, spits, or barrier islands.

9.17 Protecting Shorelines

• Describe the barriers humans construct to protect beaches.

Why do you see man-made structures on some beaches?
When you go to a beach, you may see man-made structures like these. Most attempt to keep the sand where people
want the sand to be. A smaller number keep the sand from coming into an area where it is not wanted.

Protecting Shorelines

Shores are attractive places to live and vacation. But development at the shore is at risk of damage from waves.
Wave erosion threatens many homes and beaches on the ocean. This is especially true during storms, when waves
may be much larger than normal. People build several types of structures to protect beaches.

Breakwaters

Barrier islands provide natural protection to shorelines. Storm waves strike the barrier island before they reach
the shore. People also build artiﬁcial barriers, called breakwaters. Breakwaters also protect the shoreline from
incoming waves. The breakwater pictured below ( Figure 9.46) runs parallel to the coast like a barrier island.

Groins

Longshore drift can erode the sediment from a beach. To keep this from happening, people may build a series of
groins. A groin ( Figure 9.47) is wall of rocks or concrete. The structure juts out into the ocean perpendicular to
the shore. A groin stops the longshore movement of sand. Sand collects on the up-current side of the groin. Sand on
opposite of side of the groin erodes. This reduces beach erosion.

Seawalls

A seawall is also parallel to the shore. However, a seawall is built onshore. Seawalls ( Figure 9.48) protect the shore
from incoming waves.

FIGURE 9.48
This seawall protects a shore in Vancouver.

Does Protection Work?

People do not always want to choose safe building practices, and instead choose to build a beach house right on the
beach. Protecting development from wave erosion is difﬁcult and expensive.
Protection does not always work. The northeastern coast of Japan was protected by anti-tsunami seawalls. Yet waves
from the 2011 tsunami that resulted from the T¯ohoku earthquake washed over the top of some seawalls and caused
others to collapse. Japan is now planning to build even higher seawalls to prepare for any future (and inevitable)
tsunami.

Summary

• People love the shore, so they develop these regions and then must protect them.
• Seawalls and breakwaters are built parallel to the shore.
• Groins are built perpendicular to the shore. They trap sand.

9.18 Erosion by Wind

• Describe how wind erodes sediments.
• Describe the features wind erosion creates.

Is wind the greatest erosional force in the desert?
Wind can do remarkable things. It can erode rock to make beautiful shapes. Wind has eroded this rock so that it
looks like a rabbit. This limestone formation is in the Sahara Desert in Egypt. Water is the most important erosional
force even in the desert. But wind makes its mark in many ways.

Sediment Transport by Wind

Like ﬂowing water, wind picks up and transports particles. Wind carries particles of different sizes in the same ways
that water carries them ( Figure 9.49).

• Tiny particles, such as clay and silt, move by suspension. They hang in the air, sometimes for days. They

may be carried great distances and rise high above the ground.

• Larger particles, such as sand, move by saltation. The wind blows them in short hops. They stay close to the

ground.

• Particles larger than sand move by creep. The wind rolls or pushes them over the surface. They stay on the

ground.

Chapter 9. Surface Processes and Landforms

FIGURE 9.49
Wind transports particles in different ways depending on their size.

Wind Erosion

Dust storms ( Figure 9.50) are more common in dry climates. The soil is dried out and dusty. Plants may be few
and far between. Dry, bare soil is more easily blown away by the wind than wetter soil or soil held in place by plant
roots.

FIGURE 9.50
When winds whip up in the desert, they can create tremendous dust
storms.

Deﬂation

Wind blows small particles away. As a result, the ground surface gets lower and rockier; this is called deﬂation. The
rocks that are left are called desert pavement. Desert pavement is a surface covered by gravel-sized particles that
are not easily moved by wind.

Abrasion

Did you ever see workers sandblasting a building to clean it? Sand is blown onto the surface to scour away dirt and
debris. Wind-blown sand has the same effect. It scours and polishes rocks and other surfaces. Wind-blown sand
may carve rocks into interesting shapes ( Figure 9.51). This form of erosion is called abrasion. It occurs any time
rough sediments are blown or dragged over surfaces. Can you think of other ways abrasion might occur?

This incredible rock formation in Utah is the result of wind erosion.

Desert Varnish

www.ck12.org

Exposed rocks in desert areas often develop a dark brown or black coating called desert varnish ( Figure 9.52).
Wind transports clay-sized particles that chemically react with other substances at high temperatures. The coating is
formed of iron and manganese oxides.

FIGURE 9.52
Ancient people carved these petroglyphs into desert varnish at Sego
Canyon, Utah.

Summary

• Wind moves sediments by suspension, saltation, or creep.
• In deserts, wind picks up small particles and leaves behind larger rocks. This forms desert pavement.
• Moving sand may sand blast rocks and other materials causing abrasion.

9.19 Deposition by Wind

• Describe how wind transports sediments.
• List the types of deposits wind creates.

How does deposition by wind modify landscapes?
On the right is a desert mountain in Arizona. The surface in the foreground is desert pavement. How did wind
modify this landscape? On the left is a desert mountain with sand dunes in Death Valley, California. How did wind
modify this landscape? Erosion and deposition by wind leave very different landscapes behind.

Wind Deposition

Like water, when wind slows down it drops the sediment it’s carrying. This often happens when the wind has to
move over or around an obstacle. A rock or tree may cause wind to slow down. As the wind slows, it deposits the
largest particles ﬁrst. Different types of deposits form depending on the size of the particles deposited.

Sand Dunes

When the wind deposits sand, it forms small hills. These hills are called sand dunes ( Figure 9.53). For sand dunes
to form, there must be plenty of sand and wind. Sand dunes are found mainly in deserts and on beaches.

How Sand Dunes Form

What causes a sand dune to form? It starts with an obstacle, such as a rock. The obstacle causes the wind to slow
down. The wind then drops some of its sand. As more sand is deposited, the dune gets bigger. The dune becomes
the obstacle that slows the wind. This causes more sand to drop. The hill takes on the typical shape of a sand dune (
Figure 9.54).

Migration of Sand Dunes

Once a sand dune forms, it may slowly migrate over the land. The wind moves grains of sand up the gently sloping
side of the dune. This is done by saltation. When the sand grains reach the top of the dune, they slip down the
steeper side. The grains are pulled by gravity. The constant movement of sand up and over the dune causes the dune
to move along the ground. A dune moves in the same direction that the wind usually blows. Can you explain why?

the dune.

FIGURE 9.54
A sand dune has a gentle slope on the
side the wind blows from. The opposite
side has a steep slope. This side is called
the slip face.

Loess

When the wind drops ﬁne particles of silt and clay, it forms deposits called loess ( Figure 9.55). Loess deposits form
vertical cliffs. Loess can become a thick, rich soil. That’s why loess deposits are used for farming in many parts of
the world.

Seaﬂoor Mud

www.ck12.org

Fine-grained mud in the deep ocean comes from silts and clays brought from the land by wind. The particles are
deposited on the sea surface. they slowly settle to the deep ocean ﬂoor, forming brown, greenish, or reddish clays.
Volcanic ash may also settle on the seaﬂoor.

Summary

• The sand is transported until it is deposited in a sand dune.
• Sand is blown up a slope. Gravity pulls it down the other side. This is how dunes migrate.
• Loess is very ﬁne wind-blown deposits.

9.20 Erosion by Glaciers

• Describe the erosional landforms created by glaciers.

In what ways is this glacier creating distinctive landforms?
This glacier is modifying the landscape it’s ﬂowing through. Glaciers erode and deposit telltale landforms. They
show the direction a glacier ﬂowed and how far it advanced. They create fantastic and unique features in mountain
areas. Did glaciers leave clues where you live? If you live in the northern part of the United States, you might be
able to ﬁnd some. Would you know what to look for?

Erosion by Glaciers

Like ﬂowing water, ﬂowing ice erodes the land and deposits the material elsewhere. Glaciers cause erosion in two
main ways: plucking and abrasion.

• Plucking is the process by which rocks and other sediments are picked up by a glacier. They freeze to the

bottom of the glacier and are carried away by the ﬂowing ice.

• Abrasion is the process in which a glacier scrapes underlying rock. The sediments and rocks frozen in the ice
at the bottom and sides of a glacier act like sandpaper. They wear away rock. They may also leave scratches
and grooves that show the direction the glacier moved. These grooves are called glacial striations.

Valley glaciers create several unique features through erosion.

• As a valley glacier ﬂows through a V-shaped river valley, it scrapes away the sides of the valley. It carves a

U-shaped valley with nearly vertical walls ( Figure 9.56).

FIGURE 9.56
The glacier on the left is carving out the
sides of a valley. The U-shaped valley
on the right is what will be left when the
glacier melts away.

• A hanging valley was cut off from the main valley by a larger glacier ( Figure 9.57).

FIGURE 9.57
The waterfall on the right ﬂows through
a glacial valley. A larger glacier carved
the valley the water falls into. There is a
waterfall because this is a hanging valley.

• A cirque is a rounded hollow carved near the top of a mountain by a glacier ( Figure 9.58). This is where the

glacier begins. The highest cliff of a cirque is called the headwall.

FIGURE 9.58
On the left,
there are several cirques
where glaciers are originating. A glacier
melted and left behind cirques in the
mountains on the right.

• An arête is a jagged ridge that remains when cirques form on opposite sides of a mountain. A low spot in an

arête is called a col.

• A horn, like the one pictured below ( Figure 9.59), is a sharp peak that is left behind when glaciers erode all

sides of a mountain.

Summary

• Glaciers are incredibly powerful agents of erosion.
• Valley glaciers create very distinctive landforms like horns, cirques, and hanging valleys.
• Glaciers pluck rocks from valley walls. This turns a V-shaped river valley into a U-shaped glacial valley.

9.21 Deposition by Glaciers

• Describe the erosional landforms created by glaciers.
• Describe the depositional landforms created by glaciers.

How could those rocks on the glacier modify the landscape?
Glaciers modify the landscape by erosion. They also modify the landscape by deposition. Glaciers carry an
enormous amount of material and dump it. The features they leave behind show where they were and what happened
as they were melting away.

Deposition by Glaciers

As glaciers ﬂow, mechanical weathering loosens rocks on the valley walls. These rocks falls onto the glacier.
Glaciers can carry rocks of any size, from giant boulders to silt. The glacier may carry the rocks for many kilometers
over many years. Glaciers deposit the sediment when they melt. They drop and leave behind whatever was once
frozen in their ice.

Erratics

Giant rocks carried by a glacier are eventually dropped. These glacial erratics, like the one pictured below ( Figure
9.60), are noticeable because they are huge. Also, they are usually a different rock type from the surrounding
bedrock.

Glacial Till

The material dropped by a glacier is usually a mixture of particles and rocks of all sizes. This unsorted pile is called
glacial till. Water from the melting ice may form lakes or other water features. The Figure 9.61 shows some of the

FIGURE 9.60

glacier.

landforms glaciers deposit when they melt.

• A moraine is sediment deposited by a glacier. A ground moraine is a thick layer of sediments left behind by
a retreating glacier. An end moraine is a low ridge of sediments deposited at the end of the glacier. It marks
the greatest distance the glacier advanced.

FIGURE 9.61
The hikers are standing on a moraine. What erosional feature is the hikers
looking at?

• A drumlin is a long, low hill of sediments deposited by a glacier. Drumlins often occur in groups called
drumlin ﬁelds. The narrow end of each drumlin points in the direction the glacier was moving when it dropped
the sediments.

• An esker is a winding ridge of sand deposited by a stream of meltwater. Such streams ﬂow underneath a

retreating glacier.

• A kettle lake occurs where a chunk of ice was left behind in the till of a retreating glacier. When the ice
melted, it left a depression. The meltwater ﬁlled it to form a lake. You can see examples of kettle lakes below
( Figure 9.62).

FIGURE 9.62
Kettle lakes are found where ice sheets once covered the land. These are
in Siberia.

Varves

www.ck12.org

Several types of stratiﬁed deposits form in glacial regions but are not formed directly by the ice. Varves form where
lakes are covered by ice in the winter. Dark, ﬁne-grained clays sink to the bottom of the lake in winter. Melting ice
in the spring brings running water that deposits lighter colored sands. Each alternating dark/light layer represents
one year of deposits.

Summary

• Glaciers dump glacial till. Glacial moraines outline a glacier’s extent.
• Drumlins, eskers, and kettle lakes are features made of glacial till.
• Varves form in lakes covered by ice. Varves are useful to scientists for understanding climate.

9.22 Landforms from Erosion and Deposition by

Gravity

• Describe how gravity erodes and deposits sediments.

What can cause devastation four months after a volcanic eruption?
Four months after Mt. Merapi in Indonesia erupted, there is more devastation. Rain continually washes ash
downslope in massive ash ﬂows. Residents are unable to live well under these conditions.

Landforms and Gravity

Gravity is responsible for erosion by ﬂowing water and glaciers. That’s because gravity pulls water and ice downhill.
These are ways gravity causes erosion indirectly. But gravity also causes erosion directly. Gravity can pull soil,
mud, and rocks down cliffs and hillsides. This type of erosion and deposition is called mass wasting. It may happen
suddenly. Or it may occur very slowly, over many years.

Landslides

Landslides are the most dramatic, sudden, and dangerous types of mass wasting. Landslides are sudden falls of
rock; by contrast, avalanches are sudden falls of snow.
Weathered material may fall away from a cliff because there is nothing to keep it in place. Rocks that fall to the base
of a cliff make a talus slope. Sometimes as one rock falls, it hits another rock, which hits another rock, and begins
a landslide.

729

9.22. Landforms from Erosion and Deposition by Gravity

www.ck12.org

A landslide can be very destructive ( Figure 9.63). It may bury or carry away entire villages. Air trapped under the
falling rocks acts as a cushion that keeps the rock from slowing down. Landslides can move as fast as 200 to 300
km/hour.

FIGURE 9.63
This landslide in California in 2008 blocked Highway 140.

Landslides often occur on steep slopes in dry or semi-arid climates. The California coastline, with its steep cliffs
and years of drought punctuated by seasons of abundant rainfall, is prone to landslides. Wet soil becomes slippery
and heavy. Earthquakes often trigger landslides. The shaking ground causes soil and rocks to break loose and start
sliding.

• Rapid downslope movement of material is seen in this video: http://faculty.gg.uwyo.edu/heller/SedMovs/Se

d%20Movie%20ﬁles/dflows.mov .

Mudﬂows and Lahars

A mudﬂow is the sudden ﬂow of mud down a slope because of gravity. Mudﬂows occur where the soil is mostly
clay. Like landslides, mudﬂows usually occur when the soil is wet. Wet clay forms very slippery mud that slides
easily. Mudﬂows follow river channels, washing out bridges, trees, and homes that are in their path.

• A debris ﬂow is seen in this video: http://faculty.gg.uwyo.edu/heller/SedMovs/Sed%20Movie%20ﬁles/Mo

scardo.mov .

A lahar is mudﬂow that ﬂows down a composite volcano ( Figure 9.64). Ash mixes with snow and ice melted by
the eruption to produce hot, fast-moving ﬂows. The lahar caused by the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Columbia in
1985 killed more than 23,000 people.

Slump and Creep

Less dramatic types of mass wasting move Earth materials slowly down a hillside. Slump is the sudden movement
of large blocks of rock and soil down a slope. ( Figure 9.65). All the material moves together in big chunks. Slumps
may happen when a layer of slippery, wet clay is underneath the rock and soil on a hillside. Or they may occur when
a river (or road) undercuts a slope. Slump leaves behind crescent-shaped scars on the hillside.
Creep is the very slow movement of rock and soil down a hillside. Creep occurs so slowly you can’t see it happening.
You can only see the effects of creep after years of movement ( Figure 9.66). The slowly moving ground causes
trees, fence posts, and other structures on the surface to tilt downhill.

Prevention and Awareness

Landslides cause $1 billion to $2 billion damage in the United States each year. Mass wasting is responsible for
traumatic and sudden loss of life and homes in many areas of the world.

Slump material moves as a whole unit, leaving behind a crescent shaped
scar.

FIGURE 9.66
As the hillside moves down slope a tree tries to stand up straight. The tree
ends up with a bent trunk.

Some communities have developed landslide warning systems. Around San Francisco Bay, the National Weather
Service and the U.S. Geological Survey use rain gauges to monitor soil moisture. If soil becomes saturated, the
weather service issues a warning. Earthquakes, which may occur on California’s abundant faults, can also trigger
landslides.
To be safe from landslides:

• Be aware of your surroundings. Notice changes in the natural world.
• Look for cracks or bulges in hillsides, tilting of decks or patios, or leaning poles or fences when rainfall is
heavy. Sticking windows and doors can indicate ground movement. This is because soil pushes slowly against
a house and knocks windows and doors out of alignment.

• Look for landslide scars. Landslides are most likely to happen where they have occurred before.
• Plant vegetation and trees on the hillside around your home. This helps hold the soil in place.
• Help to keep a slope stable by building retaining walls. Installing good drainage in a hillside may keep the

731

9.22. Landforms from Erosion and Deposition by Gravity

soil from getting saturated.

Summary

• Landslides are sudden and massive falls of rock down a slope. Landslides may be very destructive or even

deadly. Slump and creep are slower types of mass wasting.

• Mudﬂows or lahars, which are volcanic mudﬂows, are mass movements that contain a lot of water.
• Mass wasting is more likely to occur on slopes that are wet, have weak rock, or are undercut. An earthquake

or other ground shaking can trigger a landslide.

• To avoid being in a landslide, be aware of signs in a hillside, such as cracks or bulges and old landslide scars.

To keep a slope stable, install good drainage or build retaining walls.

Summary

Chapter 9. Surface Processes and Landforms

The weathering of rocks and minerals can be mechanical or chemical. Mechanical weathering changes the size of
a mineral or rock. Mechanical weathering does not change the chemical composition of that material. Chemical
weathering changes the composition of a mineral or rock. Different types of weathering can alter the same material.
Soil forms on top of rock. The type of soil that forms depends on the environment of the region. For example, warm
and wet climates form different soils than cold and dry climates. A proﬁle through the soil shows different horizons.
Topsoil is the most important layer for crops. Water, ice, wind, and gravity create or modify landforms on Earth’s
surface. These agents can erode or deposit features that indicate their presence. Erosion by water and ice lowered
and rounded the Appalachians. These old mountains no longer look like the Himalaya. Someday the Himalaya may
look like the Appalachians do now.

Introduction

www.ck12.org

What has led to these landforms? How do we know?
This is North America right now. You can pick out a lot of features that we’ve been studying. You can even pick out
evidence of different processes. Continental rifting? See where Baja California is separating from the rest of Mexico.
Mountain building? You can see the Sierra Nevada, Cascades, and Rocky Mountains, among others. Weathering is
seen in the red dirt in the Four Corners area. The Great Lakes are remnants of the giant glaciers that covered the
northern region. Shallow limestone shelves are seen surrounding Florida. How we know what we know and what
we know about Earth history is touched on very brieﬂy in this concept.

10.1 How Fossilization Creates Fossils

• Describe body and trace fossils.

How do you ﬁnd fossils?
In lots of places, you can go on a ﬁeld trip to ﬁnd fossils. The fossils are found in rock layers. You can break apart
the rock layers and ﬁnd the fossils.

What Are Fossils?

Fossils are preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past. Most preserved remains are hard parts,
such as teeth, bones, or shells. Hard parts are less likely to be destroyed before they can become fossils. Even so,
a very tiny percentage of living things become fossils. These types of fossils are called body fossils ( Figure 10.1,
Figure 10.2, and Figure 10.3).

FIGURE 10.1
The preserved remains of an ammonite.

Preserved traces can include footprints, burrows, or even wastes. Examples of these types of fossils, called trace
fossils are picture below ( Figure 10.4 and Figure 10.5).

Summary

• Fossils are the remains or traces of living organisms.
• Body fossils are usually hard parts, such as bones, teeth, and shells.
• Trace fossils are the traces of organisms, not parts of them. Trace fossils include footprints, feces, and burrows.

10.2 Types of Fossilization

• Learn the processes that create fossils.

Where could you ﬁnd the best fossils?
The best fossils would probably be ones that you could get DNA from. DNA holds the genes of an organisms. The
genes could tell scientists a lot about what the organisms was really like. Where could you ﬁnd a fossil with DNA?
How about a melting glacier? You might be able to ﬁnd a creature that had been frozen into the ice for a long time.
A frozen animal would be very well preserved!

How Fossils Form

The process by which remains or traces of living things become fossils is called fossilization ( Figure 10.6). Most
fossils are preserved in sedimentary rocks.

Fossils in Sedimentary Rock

Most fossils form when a dead organism is buried in sediment. Layers of sediment slowly build up. The sediment is
buried and turns into sedimentary rock. The remains inside the rock also turn to rock. The remains are replaced by
minerals. The remains literally turn to stone. This type of fossilization is called permineralization.

742

Chapter 10. Earth History

FIGURE 10.6
Fossilization. This ﬂowchart shows how
most fossils form.

Other Ways Fossils Form

Fossils may form in other ways. With complete preservation, the organism doesn’t change much. As pictured below
( Figure 10.7), tree sap may cover an organism and then turn into amber. The original organism is preserved so that
scientists might be able to study its DNA. Organisms can also be completely preserved in tar or ice.
Molds and casts are another way organisms can be fossilized. A mold is an imprint of an organism left in rock. The
organism’s remains break down completely. Rock that ﬁlls in the mold resembles the original remains. The fossil
that forms in the mold is called a cast ( Figure 10.8). Molds and casts usually form in sedimentary rock. With
compression ( Figure 10.9), an organism’s remains are put under great pressure inside rock layers. This leaves
behind a dark stain in the rock.

Why Fossilization is Rare

It’s very unlikely that any given organism will become a fossil. The remains of many organisms are consumed.
Remains also may be broken down by other living things or by the elements. Hard parts, such as bones, are much
more likely to become fossils. But even they rarely last long enough to become fossils. Organisms without hard

parts are the least likely to be fossilized. Fossils of soft organisms, from bacteria to jellyﬁsh, are very rare.

Summary

• Very few fossils preserve soft parts. Insects may be preserved in amber. Insects and other animals may be

preserved in ice.

• Some fossils are created when minerals replace the organic material. This is called permineralization.
• A fossil may be in the form of a mold. A mold is the depression left in the shape of the material.
• A fossil may be preserved as a cast. A cast is the rocky material that ﬁlls the mold.

10.3 Earth History and Clues from Fossils

• Describe how fossils are used to learn about Earth’s past.

How could there be seashells at 20,000 feet?
Shell beds are found high in the Andes Mountains. How did they get there? This is more evidence that Earth is
a dynamic planet! The rock that is on top of the mountains was once beneath the sea. Due to plate tectonics, the
mountains rose slowly above the ocean. This process took a really long time. This is one way we know that Earth is
really old!

Learning from Fossils

Of all the organisms that ever lived, only a tiny number became fossils. Still, scientists learn a lot from fossils.
Fossils are our best clues about the history of life on Earth.

Fossil Clues

Fossils give clues about major geological events. Fossils, like the one pictured below ( Figure 10.10), can also give
clues about past climates. Here are just a few examples.

• Fossils of ocean animals are found at the top of Mt. Everest. Mt. Everest is the highest mountain on Earth.
These fossils show that the area was once at the bottom of a sea. The seabed was later uplifted to form the
Himalaya mountain range.

• Fossils of plants are found in Antarctica. Currently, Antarctica is almost completely covered with ice. The

fossil plants show that Antarctica once had a much warmer climate.

Index Fossils

Fossils are used to determine the ages of rock layers. Index fossils are the most useful for this. Index fossils are of
organisms that lived over a wide area. They lived for a fairly short period of time. An index fossil allows a scientist
to determine the age of the rock it is in.

FIGURE 10.10
What can we learn from fossil clues like this ﬁsh fossil found in the
Wyoming desert?

Trilobite fossils ( Figure 10.11) are common index fossils. Trilobites were widespread marine animals. They lived
between 500 and 600 million years ago. Rock layers containing trilobite fossils must be that age. Different species
of trilobite fossils can be used to narrow the age even more.

FIGURE 10.11
Trilobites are good index fossils. Why are trilobite fossils useful as index
fossils?

Summary

• Fossils tell a lot about the environment during the time they were deposited.
• Climate is one important thing that can be indicated by fossils. This is because organisms have speciﬁc

conditions in which they can live.

• An index fossil must be distinctive, widespread, and short-lived. It indicates a speciﬁc period of time.

10.4 Principles of Relative Dating

• Describe how Steno’s laws are used to determine the geologic history of a region.

Where’s a good place to see geology?
The Southwestern United States is a fantastic place to see geology. The arid climate means that that the rocks are
not covered by vegetation. In many places, especially the national parks, the formations are fantastic. The rocks
themselves are very interesting. The principles discussed below are easily seen around the Southwest.

Relative Age Dating

Early geologists had no way to determine the absolute age of a geological material. If they didn’t see it form, they
couldn’t know if a rock was one hundred years or 100 million years old. What they could do was determine the ages
of materials relative to each other. Using sensible principles they could say whether one rock was older than another.
They could also determine when a process occurred relative to those rocks.

Laws of Stratigraphy

The study of rock strata is called stratigraphy. The laws of stratigraphy can help scientists understand Earth’s past.
The laws of stratigraphy are usually credited to a geologist from Denmark named Nicolas Steno. He lived in the
1600s. The laws are illustrated in the Figure 10.12; refer to the ﬁgure as you read about Steno’s laws below.

FIGURE 10.12
(a) Original horizontality. (b) Lateral conti-
nuity. (c) Superposition.

Law of Superposition

Superposition refers to the position of rock layers and their relative ages ( Figure 10.13). Relative age means age
in comparison with other rocks, either younger or older. The relative ages of rocks are important for understanding
Earth’s history. New rock layers are always deposited on top of existing rock layers. Therefore, deeper layers must
be older than layers closer to the surface. This is the law of superposition.

FIGURE 10.13
Superposition. The rock layers at
the
bottom of this cliff are much older than
those at the top. What force eroded the
rocks and exposed the layers?

Law of Lateral Continuity

Rock layers extend laterally, or out to the sides. They may cover very broad areas, especially if they formed at the
bottom of ancient seas. Erosion may have worn away some of the rock, but layers on either side of eroded areas will
still “match up.”
The Grand Canyon ( Figure 10.14 is a good example of lateral continuity. You can clearly see the same rock layers
on opposite sides of the canyon. The matching rock layers were deposited at the same time, so they are the same
age.

Chapter 10. Earth History

FIGURE 10.14
Lateral Continuity. Layers of the same
rock type are found across canyons at the
Grand Canyon.

Law of Original Horizontality

Sediments were deposited in ancient seas in horizontal, or ﬂat, layers. If sedimentary rock layers are tilted, they
must have moved after they were deposited.

Law of Cross-Cutting Relationships

Rock layers may have another rock cutting across them, like the igneous rock pictured below ( Figure 10.15). Which
rock is older? To determine this, we use the law of cross-cutting relationships. The cut rock layers are older than the
rock that cuts across them.

FIGURE 10.15
Cross-cutting relationships in rock layers.
The rock layers at
the bottom are cut
off by the rock layers that are higher up.
Which layers are older and which are
younger?

Unconformities

Geologists can learn a lot about Earth’s history by studying sedimentary rock layers. But in some places, there’s a
gap in time when no rock layers are present. A gap in the sequence of rock layers is called an unconformity.

751

10.4. Principles of Relative Dating

www.ck12.org

Look at the rock layers pictured below ( Figure 10.16); they show a feature called Hutton’s unconformity. The
unconformity was discovered by James Hutton in the 1700s. Hutton saw that the lower rock layers are very old. The
upper layers are much younger. There are no layers in between the ancient and recent layers. Hutton thought that
the intermediate rock layers eroded away before the more recent rock layers were deposited.
Hutton’s discovery was a very important event in geology! Hutton determined that the rocks were deposited over
time. Some were eroded away. Hutton knew that deposition and erosion are very slow. He realized that for both to
occur would take an extremely long time. This made him realize that Earth must be much older than people thought.
This was a really big discovery! It meant there was enough time for life to evolve gradually.

FIGURE 10.16
Hutton’s unconformity, in Scotland.

Summary

• Sediments are deposited horizontally. This is original horizontality.
• The oldest sedimentary rocks are at the bottom of the sequence. This is the law of superposition.
• Rock layers are laterally continuous.This is the law of lateral continuity.
• Rock B cuts across rock A. Rock A must be older. This is the principle of cross-cutting relationships.
• A gap in a rock sequence is an unconformity.

10.5 Determining Relative Ages

• Be able to determine the relative ages of a set of rocks.
• Understand the processes that can alter a set of rocks.

What are the relative ages of these rocks?
This photo shows rock layers and a fault—the fault is the large diagonal crack running through this rock. These
features can tell us several things about relative age. Unless the rock was turned over somehow, we can assume that
the layers on top are younger than the layers on the bottom. Since the fault separates the layers, we can tell that the
fault occurred after all the layers were deposited.

Determining the Relative Ages of Rocks

Steno’s principles are essential for determining the relative ages of rocks and rock layers. Remember that in relative
dating, scientists do not determine the exact age of a fossil or rock. They look at a sequence of rocks to try to
decipher when an event occurred relative to the other events represented in that sequence. The relative age of a
rock, then, is its age in comparison with other rocks. (1) Do you know which rock is older and which is younger?
(2) Do you know how old the rock’s layers are in years? For relative ages, you know #1 but not #2.
An interactive website on relative ages and geologic time is found here: http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/education/e
xplorations/tours/geotime/gtpage1.html .
In some cases, it is very tricky to determine the sequence of events that leads to a certain formation. In the picture
below, can you ﬁgure out what happened in what order ( Figure 10.17)? Write it down and then check the following
paragraphs.
The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that a fault or intrusion is younger than the rocks that it cuts
through. The fault cuts through all three sedimentary rock layers (A, B, and C) and also the intrusion (D). So the
fault must be the youngest feature. The intrusion (D) cuts through the three sedimentary rock layers, so it must be

younger than those layers. By the law of superposition, C is the oldest sedimentary rock, B is younger and A is still
younger.
The full sequence of events is:

1. Layer C formed.
2. Layer B formed.
3. Layer A formed.
4. After layers A-B-C were present, intrusion D cut across all three.
5. Fault E formed, shifting rocks A through C and intrusion D.
6. Weathering and erosion created a layer of soil on top of layer A.

Summary

• The oldest rock units lie beneath the younger ones.
• By the principle of cross-cutting relationships (and common sense), we know that something must exist before

something else can cut across it.

• The history of a section of rocks can be deciphered using the principles outlined in this concept.

10.6 Correlation Using Relative Ages

• Learn what makes a rock unit useful for correlation.

How would you correlate two rock units?
On a ﬁeld trip in the southwestern United States you would see some very unique rock layers. You might see a
distinctive whitish rock unit that looks like sand dunes. This rock is the Navajo Sandstone. The ﬁrst photo is from
the Valley of Fire near Las Vegas, Nevada. The second is from Capitol Reef National Park in Utah. These sites are
roughly 250 miles apart. Sand dunes stretched across this part of the country during the Mesozoic.

Matching Rock Layers

When rock layers are in the same place, it’s easy to give them relative ages. But what if rock layers are far apart?
What if they are on different continents? What evidence is used to match rock layers in different places?

757

10.6. Correlation Using Relative Ages

www.ck12.org

Widespread Rock Layers

Some rock layers extend over a very wide area. They may be found on more than one continent or in more than
one country. They are matched up by correlation. For example, the famous White Cliffs of Dover are on the coast
of southeastern England. These distinctive rocks are matched by similar white cliffs in France, Belgium, Holland,
Germany, and Denmark ( Figure 10.18). It is important that this chalk layer goes across the English Channel. The
rock is so soft that the Channel Tunnel connecting England and France was carved into it!

FIGURE 10.18
Chalk Cliffs.
Denmark and (B) in Dover, U.K.

(A) Matching chalk cliffs in

Key Beds

Like index fossils, key beds are used to match rock layers. A key bed is a thin layer of rock. The rock must be unique
and widespread. For example, a key bed from around the time that the dinosaurs went extinct is very important. A
thin layer of clay was deposited over much of Earth’s surface. The clay has large amount of the element iridium.
Iridium is rare on Earth but common in asteroids. This unusual clay layer has been used to match rock up layers all
over the world. It also led to the hypothesis that a giant asteroid struck Earth and caused the dinosaurs to go extinct.

Using Index Fossils

Index fossils are commonly used to match rock layers in different places ( Figure 10.19). If two rock layers have
the same index fossils, then they’re probably about the same age.

Summary

• A single rock unit contains the story of the geology of that location. To understand the geology of a region,

scientists use correlation.

• To correlate rock units, something distinctive must be present in each. This can include an index fossil, a

unique rock type, a key bed, or a unique sequence of rocks.

• A key bed can be global. An example is the iridium layer that was deposited at the time of the Cretaceous-

Tertiary extinctions.

10.7. Geologic Time Scale

www.ck12.org

10.7 Geologic Time Scale

• The geologic time scale gives names to time periods in Earth history.

Why would you want to name time?
When you refer to events in the history of your life you often link it to a time period. "When I was in kindergarten..."
might be the start of your story. It helps scientists to have names to refer to events in Earth history. For this reason,
they developed the geologic time scale.

The Geologic Time Scale

Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago. Geologists divide this time span into smaller periods. Many of the divisions
mark major events in life history.

Dividing Geologic Time

Divisions in Earth history are recorded on the geologic time scale. For example, the Cretaceous ended when the
dinosaurs went extinct. European geologists were the ﬁrst to put together the geologic time scale. So, many of the

760

www.ck12.org

Chapter 10. Earth History

names of the time periods are from places in Europe. The Jurassic Period is named for the Jura Mountains in France
and Switzerland, for example.

Putting Events in Order

To create the geologic time scale, geologists correlated rock layers. Steno’s laws were used to determine the relative
ages of rocks. Older rocks are at the bottom, and younger rocks are at the top. The early geologic time scale
could only show the order of events. The discovery of radioactivity in the late 1800s changed that. Scientists could
determine the exact age of some rocks in years. They assigned dates to the time scale divisions. For example, the
Jurassic began about 200 million years ago. It lasted for about 55 million years.

Divisions of the Geologic Time Scale

The largest blocks of time on the geologic time scale are called “eons.” Eons are split into “eras.” Each era is divided
into “periods.” Periods may be further divided into “epochs.” Geologists may just use “early” or “late.” An example
is “late Jurassic,” or “early Cretaceous.” Pictured below is the geologic time scale ( Figure 10.20).

FIGURE 10.20
The Geologic Time Scale.

Summary

• The geologic time scale divides Earth history into named units. Naming time periods makes it easier to talk

about them.

• The units of the time scale are separated by major events in Earth or life history.
• In the geologic time scale, time units are divided and subdivided into smaller pieces.

10.8 Tree Rings, Ice Cores, and Varves

• Learn three ways that scientists can get an absolute age: tree rings, ice cores, and varves.

How could you tell the age of this ruin?
Mesa Verde in Southwestern Colorado is the site of beautiful cliff dwellings. The people who inhabited these
dwellings are long gone.
If you go there you will hear the history of the area, complete with dates. How do
archeologists know when the people lived here? How do they know the ages of the structures there? Tree ring dating
is extremely useful for ﬁnding the age of ancient structures.

Tree Ring Dating

Cut into a tree and you can see its rings. In some locations, the summer growth band is light-colored and the winter
band is dark. Each light-dark band represents one year. You can tell how long the tree lived by counting the number
of tree rings ( Figure 10.21). Age dating by tree rings is called dendrochronology.

FIGURE 10.21
Cross-section showing growth rings.

763

10.8. Tree Rings, Ice Cores, and Varves

www.ck12.org

You can tell other things from tree rings too. In a good year a tree will produce a wide ring. A summer drought will
produce a smaller ring. These variations will appear in all trees in a region. The same pattern can be found in all the
trees in the area. This pattern helps scientist to identify a particular time period.
Scientists have records of tree rings going back over the past 2,000 years. By matching up patterns they can tell
when a tree (or a piece of wood from one) lived. Wood fragments from old buildings and ancient ruins can be age
dated. The outermost ring gives the date when the tree died.
An example of how tree-ring dating is used to date houses in the United Kingdom is found in the following article:

Other processes create yearly layers that can be used for dating. On a glacier, snow falls in winter. In summer,
dust accumulates. This leads to a snow-dust annual pattern. This pattern can be seen down into the ice ( Figure
10.22). Scientists drill deep into ice sheets. Ice cores can be hundreds of meters long. The ice cores show how the
environment has changed. Gas bubbles in the ice can be analyzed to show how atmospheric gases have changed.
This can yield clues about climate. Long ice cores have allowed scientists to create a record of polar climate going
back hundreds of thousands of years.

FIGURE 10.22
Ice core section showing annual layers.

Varves

Lake sediments also have an annual pattern. This is easy to see in lakes that are located at the end of glaciers. The
glacier melts rapidly in the summer. This produces a thick deposit of sediment in the lake. Thin, clay-rich layers
are deposited in the winter. The resulting layers are called varves. Varves give scientists clues about past climate
conditions ( Figure 10.23). A warm summer might result in a very thick sediment layer. A cooler summer might
yield a thinner layer. Like tree rings, these patterns can be used to identify time periods.

10.9 Radioactive Decay as a Measure of Age

• Radioactive decay gives a way to determine the age of some types of rocks.

When do you stop counting?
Pretend that the large green cylinder is a parent isotope. Now you can visualize the decay of the parent to the
daughter. It’s easy to see that the second cylinder is half the size of the ﬁrst. The third is half the size of the second.
But when the cylinders get small, the differences are much harder to see. At some point, there is too little of the
parent left. That isotope pair is no longer useful for dating.

Radioactive Decay

Radioactive decay is the breakdown of unstable elements into stable elements. To understand this process, recall
that the atoms of all elements contain the particles protons, neutrons, and electrons.

Isotopes

An element is deﬁned by the number of protons it contains. All atoms of a given element contain the same number of
protons. The number of neutrons in an element may vary. Atoms of an element with different numbers of neutrons
are called isotopes.
Consider carbon as an example. Two isotopes of carbon are shown below ( Figure 10.24). Compare their protons
and neutrons. Both contain six protons. But carbon-12 has six neutrons and carbon-14 has eight neutrons.
Almost all carbon atoms are carbon-12. This is a stable isotope of carbon. Only a tiny percentage of carbon atoms
are carbon-14. carbon-14 is unstable. It is a radioactive isotope of carbon. Pictured below is carbon dioxide (

Chapter 10. Earth History

FIGURE 10.24
Isotopes are named for their number of protons plus neutrons. If a carbon atom had seven neutrons, what would
it be named?

Figure 10.25), which forms in the atmosphere from carbon-14 and oxygen. Neutrons in cosmic rays strike nitrogen
atoms in the atmosphere. The nitrogen forms carbon-14. Carbon in the atmosphere combines with oxygen to form
carbon dioxide. Plants take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. In this way, carbon-14 enters food chains.

FIGURE 10.25
Carbon-14 forms in the atmosphere. It combines with oxygen and forms
carbon dioxide. How does carbon-14 end up in fossils?

Decay of Unstable Isotopes

Like other unstable isotopes, carbon-14 breaks down, or decays. The original atoms are called the parent isotopes.
For carbon-14 decay, each carbon-14 atom loses an beta particle. It changes to a stable atom of nitrogen-14. The
stable atom at the end is the daughter product ( Figure 10.26).
The decay of an unstable isotope to a stable element occurs at a constant rate. This rate is different for each parent-
daughter isotope pair. The decay rate is measured in a unit called the half-life. The half-life is the time it takes for
half of a given amount of an isotope to decay. For example, the half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730 years. Imagine that
you start out with 100 grams of carbon-14. In 5,730 years, half of it decays. This leaves 50 grams of carbon-14.

FIGURE 10.26
Unstable isotopes, such as carbon-14, decay by losing atomic particles.
They form different, stable elements when they decay.

Over the next 5,730 years, half of the remaining amount will decay. Now there are 25 grams of carbon-14. How
many grams will there be in another 5,730 years? The ﬁgure below graphs the rate of decay of a substance ( Figure
10.27).

FIGURE 10.27
The rate of decay of a radioactive sub-
stance is constant over time.

Summary

• A half-life is the time it takes for half of the parent isotopes of an element to change to the daughter product.
• With alpha decay, the nucleus loses two protons and two neutrons.
• Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years.

10.10 Radiometric Dating

• Radiometric dating uses radioactive isotopes to get the absolute ages of rocks and other materials.

Can wood give an age in another way?
In the section on tree ring dating, there was a photo of a ruin at Mesa Verde National Park. This photo is also from
Mesa Verde. In archeological sites, wood can be dated by tree rings. It can also be dated by radiometric dating.
Carbon-14 dating is very useful for ruins that contain wood. If the tree died around the time the ladder was created,
then carbon-14 can tell the age of the ladder. If the ladder was built for the site, then that age will be the age of the
archeological site.

Radiometric Dating

The rate of decay of unstable isotopes can be used to estimate the absolute ages of fossils and rocks. This type of
dating is called radiometric dating.

Carbon-14 Dating

The best-known method of radiometric dating is carbon-14 dating. This method is also called radiocarbon dating.
A living thing takes in carbon-14 (along with stable carbon-12). As the carbon-14 decays, it is replaced with more
carbon-14. After the organism dies, it stops taking in carbon. That includes carbon-14. The carbon-14 that is in
its body continues to decay. So the organism contains less and less carbon-14 as time goes on. We can estimate
the amount of carbon-14 that has decayed by measuring the amount of carbon-14 to carbon-12. We know how fast
carbon-14 decays. With this information, we can tell how long ago the organism died.

770

www.ck12.org

Chapter 10. Earth History

Carbon-14 has a relatively short half-life. It decays quickly compared to some other unstable isotopes. So carbon-
14 dating is useful for specimens younger than 50,000 years old. That’s a blink of an eye in geologic time. But
radiocarbon dating is very useful for more recent events. One important use of radiocarbon is early human sites.
Carbon-14 dating is also limited to the remains of once-living things. To date rocks, scientists use other radioactive
isotopes.

Other Radioactive Isotopes

The isotopes listed below ( Table 10.1) are used to date igneous rocks. These isotopes have much longer half-lives
than carbon-14. Because they decay more slowly, they can be used to date much older specimens. Which of these
isotopes could be used to date a rock that formed half a million years ago? How about half a billion years ago?

Limitations of Radiometric Dating

Radiometric dating is a very useful tool, but it does have limits:

1. The material being dated must have measurable amounts of the parent and/or the daughter isotopes.
2. Radiometric dating can only be done on some materials. It is not useful for determining the age of sedimentary
rocks. For this, geologists date a nearby igneous rock. Then they use relative dating techniques to ﬁgure out
the age of the sedimentary rock. They may not get it exactly, but there will be some idea.

Summary

• Radiocarbon is useful for relatively young, carbon-based materials. Other longer-lived isotopes are good for

older rocks and minerals.

• Different isotope pairs are useful for certain materials of certain ages.
• Radiometric dating cannot be used if parent or daughter are not measurable.

10.12 Formation of the Sun and Planets

• Describe how the bodies of the solar system formed.
• Describe the basic characteristics of the planets of the solar system.

Where are stars born? Are stars being born right now?
Stars are born in clouds like the one in the picture. Gravity pulls material together. When it is extremely dense, it
begins nuclear fusion. That is, it becomes a star. We can see places where stars are being born right now. Of course,
it takes light a long time to travel to us. So what we see right now may have happened many millions or even billions
of years ago.

Formation of the Solar System

Our solar system began about 5 billion years ago. The Sun, planets, and other solar system objects all formed at
about the same time. The leading hypothesis for how they formed is called the nebular hypothesis.

776

www.ck12.org

The Solar Nebula

Chapter 10. Earth History

The Sun and planets formed from a giant cloud of gas and dust. This was the solar nebula. The cloud contracted
and began to spin. As it contracted, its temperature and pressure increased. The cloud spun faster and formed into a
disk. Scientists think the solar system at that time looked like these disk-shaped objects in the Orion Nebula. New
stars are forming in the Orion Nebula today.

Solar System Bodies Form

Gravity pulled a lot of material to the center of the cloud. Temperatures and pressures at the center of the cloud were
extreme. It was so hot that nuclear fusion reactions began. A star was born—the Sun. In these reactions, hydrogen
fuses to make helium. Extreme amounts of energy are released.

FIGURE 10.28
An artist’s painting of a protoplanetary
disk.

Meanwhile, the outer parts of the disk were cooling off. Matter condensed from the cloud. Small pieces of dust
started clumping together. These clumps collided and combined with other clumps. Gravity brought more clumps
together to make larger bodies. Gravity at the center of the disk attracted rock and metal. Lighter material remained
farther out in the disk. Eventually, these small bodies grew to become the planets and moons that we ﬁnd in our
solar system today.

The Planets

Since gravity pulled the heavy material inward, the inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are made of
rock and metal. The outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—condensed farther from the Sun ( Figure
10.29). They are made from lighter materials such as hydrogen, helium, water, ammonia, and methane. Out by
jupiter and beyond, where it’s very cold, these materials form solid particles. Dwarf plants, comets, and asteroids
formed too.
The nebular hypothesis explains the basic features of the solar system:

• The orbits of the planets lie in nearly the same plane. The Sun is at the center.
• The planets revolve in the same direction.
• The planets mostly rotate in the same direction.
• The axes of rotation of the planets are mostly nearly perpendicular to the orbital plane.
• The oldest Moon rocks are 4.5 billion years old.

10.13 Formation of Earth

• Describe how Earth formed.
• Explain the origin of the Moon from Earth.

What was early Earth like?
Earth was not always the planet it is today. In its earliest days, Earth was scorching hot. It did not have an atmosphere
or water. If life originated early on, it was wiped out by the terrible conditions.

Formation of Earth and Moon

Material at similar distances from the Sun collided together to form each of the planets. Earth grew from material in
its part of space. The Moon’s origin is completely different from Earth’s.

Earth Forms

Earth formed like the other planets. Different materials in its region of space collided. Eventually, the material made
a planet. All of the collisions caused Earth to heat up. Rock and metal melted. The molten material separated into
layers. Gravity pulled the denser material into the center. The lighter elements rose to the surface ( Figure 10.30).
Because the material separated, Earth’s core is made mostly of iron. Earth’s crust is made mostly of lighter materials.
In between the crust and the core is Earth’s mantle, made of solid rock.

Moon Forms

This model for how the Moon formed is the best ﬁt of all of the data scientists have about the Moon.

asteroid the size of Mars smashed into Earth. The huge amount of energy from the impact melted most of Earth. The
asteroid melted too. Material from both Earth and the asteroid was thrown out into orbit. Over time, this material
smashed together to form our Moon. The lunar surface of the Moon is about 4.5 billion years old. This means that
the collision happened about 70 million years after Earth formed.

Summary

• Earth grew from material that collided in its part of space.
• The material melted and gravity separated it into layers.
• An enormous asteroid struck Earth. The material ﬂew into orbit and came together to form the Moon.

10.14 Early Atmosphere and Oceans

• Describe how Earth’s early atmosphere formed
• Explain how photosynthesis affected the atmosphere and life.

What did Earth look like at ﬁrst?
The earliest Earth did not have an atmosphere or free water. The planet was far too hot for gases and water to collect.
The atmosphere and oceans that we see today evolved over time. The gases came from volcanic eruptions and from
comets.

Formation of the Atmosphere and Oceans

An atmosphere is the gases that surround a planet. The early Earth had no atmosphere. Conditions were so hot that
gases were not stable.

Earth’s First Atmosphere

Earth’s ﬁrst atmosphere was different from the current one. The gases came from two sources. Volcanoes spewed
gases into the air. Comets carried in ices from outer space. These ices warmed and became gases. Nitrogen, carbon
dioxide, hydrogen, and water vapor, or water in gas form, were in the ﬁrst atmosphere ( Figure 10.31). Take a look
at the list of gases. What’s missing? The early atmosphere had almost no oxygen.

FIGURE 10.31
Gases from Earth’s interior came through volcanoes and into the atmo-
sphere.

782

www.ck12.org

The Early Oceans

Chapter 10. Earth History

Earth’s atmosphere slowly cooled. Once it was cooler, water vapor could condense. It changed back to its liquid
form. Liquid water could fall to Earth’s surface as rain. Over millions of years water collected to form the oceans.
Water began to cycle on Earth as water evaporated from the oceans and returned again as rainfall.
Streams carry dissolved minerals. These ions make the oceans salty. Marine sedimentary rocks are found that are
four billion years old. The ﬁrst oceans could have formed as early as 4.2 to 4.4 billion years ago!

The Later Atmosphere

Eventually plants evolved. Plants produce oxygen as a product of photosynthesis. Oxygen spread around the
planet about 2.5 billion years ago. Many organisms died off because they could not handle the oxygen. But this
development was extremely important for other life. Animals need oxygen to breathe. If photosynthesis had not
evolved there would be no animals.
Oxygen is needed to make ozone. Ozone is a molecule made of three oxygen ions. Ozone in the upper atmosphere
blocks harmful solar radiation from reaching the surface. Without oxygen, life on Earth would have been very
simple.

Summary

• Earth’s ﬁrst atmosphere came from the planet’s interior. Gases also came from asteroids and comets from

elsewhere in the solar system.

• There was very little oxygen in the atmosphere until plants evolved. Oxygen allowed animals to evolve and

ozone to form.

• The ﬁrst oceans formed when water rained out of the atmosphere into basins.

10.15 Precambrian Continents

• Early continents were small and mantle convection was fast.

When did Earth become a dynamic planet?
Earth was always dynamic! Earth has changed many times over billions of years. Huge mountains have formed,
been destroyed, and been replaced with new mountains. Continents have moved, split apart, and collided with each
other. Ocean basins have opened up. Life on Earth evolved slowly for billions of years.

Early Continents

The earliest crust was probably basalt. It may have resembled the current seaﬂoor. This crust formed before there
were any oceans. More than four billion years ago, continental crust appeared. The ﬁrst continents were very small
compared with those today.

Continents Grow

Continents grow when microcontinents, or small continents, collide with each other or with a larger continent.
Oceanic island arcs also collide with continents to make them grow.

Cratons

The earliest continental crust is now found in the ancient cores of continents, called the cratons. Geologists can
learn many things about the Precambrian by studying the rocks of the cratons.

• Cratons contain felsic igneous rocks, which are remnants of the ﬁrst continents.

785

10.15. Precambrian Continents

www.ck12.org

• Cratonic rocks contain rounded sedimentary grains. Rounded grains indicate that the minerals eroded from an

earlier rock. It also means that rivers or seas existed.

• One common rock type in the cratons is greenstone, a metamorphosed volcanic rock ( Figure 10.32). Since
greenstones are found today in oceanic trenches, what does the presence of greenstones mean? These ancient
greenstones indicate the presence of subduction zones.

FIGURE 10.32
Ice age glaciers scraped the Canadian
Shield down to the 4.28 billion year old
greenstone in Northwestern Quebec.

Supercontinents

There are times in Earth history when all of the continents come together to form a supercontinent. Supercontinents
come together and then break apart. Pangaea was the last supercontinent on Earth, but it was not the ﬁrst. The
supercontinent before Pangaea is called Rodinia. Rodinia contained about 75% of the continental landmass that is
present today. The supercontinent came together about 1.1 billion years ago. Rodinia was not the ﬁrst supercontinent
either. Scientists think that three supercontinents came before Rodina, making ﬁve so far in Earth history.

Early Plate Tectonics

Since the early Earth was very hot, mantle convection was very rapid. Plate tectonics likely moved quickly. The
early Earth was an active place with abundant volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. The remnants of these early rocks
are now seen in the ancient cores of the continents.

Summary

• The ﬁrst crust was basalt. It resembled the modern seaﬂoor.
• Microcontinents come together to create continents and supercontinents.
• Convection on early Earth was faster and so plate tectonics was faster. Since then, Earth has been cooling.

10.16 Paleozoic Plate Tectonics

• Describe how supercontinents come together.
• Explain how mountain ranges are created by the process of orogeny.

Could these mountains have existed in the Paleozoic?
Sure! There have been lots of huge mountain ranges in Earth history. When continents collide, big mountains grow.
The formation of Pangaea created long large mountain ranges. The mountains that formed then look a lot like the
Himalayas do today.

The Paleozoic Era

The Paleozoic is the earliest era of the Phanerozoic. The Paleozoic was also the longest era of the Phanerozoic. But
the Paleozoic was relatively recent. It began only 570 million years ago. At the start of the Paleozoic, there was a
supercontinent called Rodinia. The supercontinent broke apart during the early part of the Paleozoic.
The Phanerozoic is recent history compared with the Precambrian. This is one reason that the Paleozoic is much
better known than the Precambrian. Another reason is that Paleozoic organisms had hard parts, and they fossilized
better.

Formation of Pangaea

A mountain-building event is called an orogeny. Orogenies take place over tens or hundreds of millions of years.
Continents smash into each other. Microcontinents and island arcs smash into continents. All of these events cause
mountains to rise.
When Pangaea came together there were orogenies all along the collision zones. Geologists ﬁnd much evidence of
these orogenies. For example, Laurentia collided with the Taconic Island Arc during the Taconic Orogeny ( Figure
10.33). The remnants of this mountain range make up the Taconic Mountains in New York.
Laurentia experienced other orogenies as it collided with the northern continents. The southern continents came
together to form Gondwana. When Laurentia and Gondwana collided to create Pangaea, the Appalachians rose.
Geologists think the Appalachians were once higher than the Himalayas are now.

Chapter 10. Earth History

FIGURE 10.33
The Taconic Orogeny is an example of a collision between a continent and a volcanic island arc.

Pangaea

Pangaea was the last supercontinent on Earth. Evidence for the existence of Pangaea was what Alfred Wegener used
to create his continental drift hypothesis. Continental drift is described in the chapter Plate Tectonics.
As the continents move, the shape of the oceans changes too. At the time of Pangaea, most of Earth’s water was
collected in a huge ocean. This ocean was called Panthalassa ( Figure 10.34).

Summary

• The Paleozoic began with the supercontinent Rodinia. The era ended with the supercontinent Pangaea.
• As continents come together, orogenies build up mountain ranges.
• Pangaea was a giant landmass made of all of the continents around 250 million years ago.

10.17 Paleozoic and Mesozoic Seas

• Describe the causes of marine transgressions and regressions.

Do you like the beach? If so, the Paleozoic may be for you!
If we were living right now at the time of a marine transgression, there would be a lot more beach. Surf’s up!

Marine Transgressions and Regressions

Sea level rises and falls. During the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, the seas rose over the continents. This is called a
marine transgression. During a marine regression, the sea level retreats. The Paleozoic had four complete cycles
of marine transgressions and regressions. The Mesozoic had two ( Figure 10.35).
What makes sea level rise? There are two possibilities: either the land sinks or the water level rises. Tectonic
processes can cause the land to sink. Melting glaciers can cause the water level to rise. Sea level rises if seaﬂoor
spreading goes faster. The hotter crust is buoyed up and displaces the water. This causes the ocean basin to become
smaller. What could cause sea level to fall in a marine regression? Land rises up. Glaciers grow. Seaﬂoor spreading
slows down. Just the opposite of what makes sea level rise!

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 10.35
Six marine transgressions and regres-
sions have occurred during the Phanero-
zoic.

Geologists think that the Paleozoic marine transgressions and regressions were the result of the decrease and increase
in the size of glaciers covering the lands.

Rock Facies

Geologists know about marine transgressions and regressions from sedimentary rocks. These events leave charac-
teristic rock layers known as sedimentary facies. Sand and other coarse grained rock fragments are deposited on the
beach where the wave energy is high. Offshore in lower energy environments, ﬁne-grained silt is deposited. Farther
offshore in lower energy waters, carbonate mud that later hardens is deposited. The rocks that result are sandstone,
shale, and limestone. As the sea moves on or offshore, one rock layer is on top of the other.

Summary

• Sea level depends on the relationship of the water level to the land.
• Sea level will rise when glaciers melt. Sea level will fall when glaciers grow.
• Facies are characteristic rock layers, such as sandstone, shale, limestone for a marine transgression. The

10.18 Mesozoic Plate Tectonics

• Describe Mesozoic plate tectonics.

Why would a supercontinent break up?
A continent is like a giant blanket that traps heat. Heat from the mantle comes up but cannot escape through the
continent. This image shows hot material beneath New Mexico. The heat is trapped beneath the North American
plate. The hot material is causing rifting to begin. This is known as the Rio Grande Rift.

Supercontinent Breakup

Why would a supercontinent break up? Remember that Earth’s interior is hot. Heat builds up beneath the supercon-
tinent. This causes the continent to buoy upward. Continental rifting begins. Basalt lava ﬁlls in the rift. This could
lead to seaﬂoor spreading and the formation of a new ocean basin. This basalt province is where Africa is splitting
apart and generating basalt lava. ( Figure 10.36)

The Breakup of Pangaea

At the end of the Paleozoic, there was one continent and one ocean. Then Pangaea began to break apart about 180
million years ago. The Panthalassa Ocean separated into the individual but interconnected oceans that we see today
on Earth.
Continental rifting and then seaﬂoor spreading pushed Africa and South America. The Atlantic Ocean basin formed
in between the continents. Seaﬂoor spreading continues to enlarge the Atlantic Ocean ( Figure 10.36).

Growth of Continents

The moving continents collided with island arcs and microcontinents. Mountain ranges grew near the continents’
edges. The oceanic Farallon plate subducted beneath western North America during the late Jurassic and early

Cretaceous. This activity produced igneous intrusions and other structures. The intrusions have since been uplifted.
They are exposed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains ( Figure 10.37).

FIGURE 10.37
The snow-covered Sierra Nevada is seen striking SE to NW across the
eastern third of the image. The mountain range is a line of uplifted
batholiths from Mesozoic subduction.

Summary

• Continents keep mantle heat from escaping. This may eventually lead to continental rifting.
• Continents grow as microcontinents or igneous activity add continental crust to an existing continent.
• When a supercontinent breaks apart, new seaﬂoor forms between the new continental masses.

10.19 Cenozoic Plate Tectonics

• The geology of the Cenozoic is familiar to us.

How does the Cenozoic end?
We don’t know how the Cenozoic ends. We’re still in it! The Cenozoic has been going on for 65 million years.
Toward the very end of this time, humans have evolved. We are now witness to the geology of the Cenozoic. What
came earlier in this era looks a lot like what is going on now.

Cenozoic

The Cenozoic began around 65.5 million years ago. We say that it begins after the Cretaceous extinction. We are
still in the Cenozoic today. The Cenozoic accounts for only about 1.5% of Earth’s total history. But since it’s the
the most recent era, it is the one we know the most about. Much of what has been discussed elsewhere in this text
describes the geology of the Cenozoic. A few highlights are mentioned here.

Plate Tectonics

The plate tectonics of the Cenozoic are still going on today. Early in the Cenozoic, blocks of crust uplifted to form
the Rocky Mountains. Subduction off of the Paciﬁc Northwest formed the Cascades volcanic arc. Crust is being
pulled apart to form the Basin and Range province that centers on Nevada.

Evolution of the San Andreas Fault

The San Andreas Fault is where the Paciﬁc and North American plates meet ( Figure 10.38). How did the San
Andreas Fault form? The Farallon Plate was subducting beneath the North American Plate. This began about 30

797

10.19. Cenozoic Plate Tectonics

www.ck12.org

million years ago. By 20 million years ago, the Paciﬁc Plate and East Paciﬁc Rise spreading center had started to
subduct. This split the Farallon Plate into two smaller plates. The plates started a transform motion where the Paciﬁc
and North American plates meet. This formed the San Andreas Fault. The fault moved inland.

FIGURE 10.38
This ﬁgure shows the evolution of the San
Andreas Fault zone from 30 million years
ago (bottom) to present (top).

Most Cenozoic plate tectonic activity involves continents moving apart. But smaller regions are coming together.
Africa collided with Eurasia to create the Alps. India crashed into Asia to form the Himalayas.

Ice Ages

The Pleistocene ice ages began 2.6 million years ago. Glaciers advanced and retreated four times ( Figure 10.39).
During the retreats, the climate was often warmer than it is today.

FIGURE 10.39
Glacial ice at its maximum during the Pleistocene.

These continental ice sheets were extremely thick, like the Antarctic ice cap is today. The Pleistocene ice ages

798

www.ck12.org

Chapter 10. Earth History

guided the evolution of life in the Cenozoic, including the evolution of humans.

Summary

• During the Cenozoic, Pangaea began to split up.
• Subduction of the Farallon plate has resulted in the formation of the Rocky Mountains and the San Andreas

Fault.

• The Pleistocene was marked by four advances of ice. The remnants of the last advance of glaciers are found

today.

Summary

Fossils are remnants of living creatures. Fossils give clues about what conditions were like when the organism lived.
Fossils help geologists understand the geological history of an area. Clues from rocks can help scientists decipher
the history of a region too. Relative dating allows geologists to ﬁgure out the order of events. Correlation allows
them to understand the geological history of a region. Absolute age dating gives real dates for geological events.
Radiometric dating uses the ratios of parent and daughter isotopes to indicate age. The solar system began as a
cloud of dust and gas. That cloud spun and contracted by gravity. The center became so dense it ignited to form
a star. Clumps of matter came together to form the planets. Shortly after Earth formed, a giant asteroid struck the
planet. Both Earth and the asteroid melted. Material was ﬂung out into Earth’s orbit. That material came together
to make the Moon. Earth had to cool before it could support an atmosphere. Once it had an atmosphere, rain fell
into basins to create the oceans. Gases in the early atmosphere came from volcanic eruptions. Comets and asteroids
also brought in gases. There was almost no oxygen. It was not until the evolution of photosynthesis that oxygen
collected in the atmosphere. With oxygen animals could evolve. Also, oxygen was needed to form the ozone layer.
The early Earth was extremely hot. Convection and plate tectonics were faster than today. During Earth history,
supercontinents formed and broke apart. Seas transgressed and regressed. Ice ages came and went.

Mars is a lot like Earth. Mars is rocky and has an atmosphere. Mars even has water! But Mars (and Mercury,
Venus, the Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) does not have any evidence of life. Life is what makes Earth
unique. It is also part of Earth’s dynamic nature. Life is part of many Earth processes. Life is also dynamic in itself.
Constantly adapting and evolving, life forms are always changing. Except those that are so well adapted to their
environment, they haven’t changed in hundreds of millions of years.

11.1 Modern Biodiversity

• Describe modern biodiversity and its relationship to evolutionary adaptations.

Do you know life on Earth?
It’s likely that there are many places on Earth that you would not recognize as being on your home planet. There
are also many creatures that you would not realize that you share a planet with. That’s because of the incredible
diversity of species. Wouldn’t it be fun to see some of these unusual creatures?

Biological Diversity

More than 1.3 million species of organisms have been cataloged. Many millions of species have not been discovered
yet. Scientists estimate that there may be about 8.7 million species in all. Why does the planet have so much
biological diversity? (Biological diversity is shortened to biodiversity.) The tremendous variety of organisms is due
to the tremendous numbers of habitats that they have evolved to ﬁll.

Ways to Live in the Environment

Each organism has the ability to survive in a speciﬁc environment. Dry desert environments are difﬁcult to live in.
Desert plants have special stems and leaves to conserve water ( Figure 11.1). Animals have other ways to live in the
desert. The Namib Desert receives only 1.5 inches of rainfall each year. The Namib Desert beetle lives there. How
do the beetles get enough water to survive? Early morning fog deposits water droplets. The droplets collect on a
beetle’s wings and back ( Figure 11.2). The beetle tilts its rear end up. When the droplet is heavy enough, it slides
forward. It lands in the beetle’s mouth. There are many other environments that need unique approaches for survival
( Figure 11.3 and 11.4).

Getting Food and Being Food (Or Not)

Organisms must be able to get food and avoid being food. Hummingbirds have long, thin beaks that help them drink
nectar from ﬂowers. Some ﬂowers are tubular. Different species of ﬂowers have tubes of different lengths. Different
species of hummingbirds have different lengths of beaks. A particular hummingbird species has evolved to feed
from one or a few species of ﬂowers.
The battle between needing food and being food plays out in the drama between lions and zebras. When a herd of
zebras senses a lion, the animals run away. The zebras’ dark stripes confuse the lions. It becomes hard for them to
focus on just one zebra. The zebras may get away. But lions are swift and agile. A lion may be able to get a zebra,
maybe one that’s old or sick.

Summary

• There are 1.3 million known species, but many more have not been discovered.
• The enormous number of species is due to the tremendous variety of environments in which they can live.
• Organisms have features that help them to ﬁnd food or avoid being eaten.

www.ck12.org

11.2 Characteristics and Origins of Life

• Describe the origins of life on Earth.
• Explain how scientists study early life.

What is life ?
How can you tell a blob of organic material from a living creature? What characteristics does something need to be
considered alive? Does this photo resemble early Earth? Erupting geysers? Mats of bacteria? Maybe so! Of course,
you have to ignore the trees in the distance.

The Origin Of Life

No one knows how or when life ﬁrst began on the turbulent early Earth. There is little hard evidence from so long
ago. Scientists think that it is extremely likely that life began and was wiped out. Possibly even more than once! If
there was life, it would have been wiped out by the impact that created the moon.
This issue of what’s living and what’s not is important. It helps us to think about the origin of life. When does a blob
of organic material become life? As you can see, we need to have a deﬁnition of life.

Characteristics of Life

To be considered alive, a molecule must:

• be organic. The organic molecules needed are amino acids.
• have a metabolism.
• be capable of replication (be able to reproduce).

808

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Life on Earth

Amino acids are molecules of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These molecules are called the building blocks of
life because they create proteins. Proteins are complex organic molecules that make up cells. They are the most
abundant class of biological molecules.

Learning About the Origin of Life

To look for information regarding the origin of life, scientists:

• perform experiments to recreate the environmental conditions found at that time.
• study the living creatures that make their homes in extreme environments. These environments are most like

Earth’s early days.

• seek traces of life left by ancient microorganisms, also called microbes ( Figure 11.5). These include
microscopic features or chemistry left by life. It is very difﬁcult to distinguish these from non-biological
features.

FIGURE 11.5
How can we tell where these microbes have been?

Summary

• For something to be alive it must be organic, have a metabolism, and be capable of replication.
• Amino acids create proteins. They are the building blocks of life.
• To learn about the origins of life, scientists perform experiments. They study creatures that live in extreme

environments. They look for traces of life that were left by ancient microbes.

11.3 Metabolism and Replication

• Deﬁne metabolism.
• Describe the relationship between nucleic acids and replication.

What is an RNA world?
DNA passes most genetic information today. But some scientists think that for the ﬁrst life on Earth, genetic
information was passed by RNA. They call this the RNA world hypothesis.

Metabolism

Organic molecules must carry out the chemical work of cells. This is their metabolism. Living organisms need
chemical reactions to live, grow, and reproduce. The chemical reactions occur in sequences of steps. These
sequences are known as metabolic pathways. The metabolic pathways are very similar for all life on Earth. That
includes single celled bacteria that have been around for billions of years. It includes the most complex life forms on
Earth today. What does it mean that the metabolic pathways are so similar for all life? This means that the metabolic
pathways evolved very early in Earth’s history.

Replication

Living cells need organic molecules, known as nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are molecules that store genetic
information. They pass that genetic information to the next generation. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the

811

11.3. Metabolism and Replication

www.ck12.org

nucleic acid that carries information for nearly all living cells today. DNA has done this for most of Earth’s history.
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) delivers genetic instructions to the location in a cell where protein is synthesized. RNA
regulates protein synthesis. Some scientists think that RNA was the ﬁrst replicating molecule.
The famous double helix structure of DNA is seen in this animation: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/common
s/8/81/ADN_animation.gif .
A segment of DNA that is inheritable is a gene. Every organism has a collection of genes that code for the traits that
organism could have. Not all genes are expressed; therefore, knowing all of your genes does not tell you exactly
who you are.

Summary

• An organism’s metabolism is the chemical reactions that allow it to live, grow, and reproduce.
• Nucleic acids pass genetic information to the next generation.
• DNA passes genetic information for living cells. RNA passes genetic information for protein synthesis.

11.4 Adaptation and Evolution of Populations

• Deﬁne adaptation.
• Explain mutations.

Why would an organism match its background? Wouldn’t it be better to stand out?
An organism that blends with its background is more likely to avoid predators. If it survives, it is more likely to have
offspring. Those offspring are more likely to blend into their backgrounds. This butterﬂy appears to be well adapted
to its environment. It is less likely to be eaten by a bird than a butterﬂy that stands out against the tree.

Variation and Adaptation

Every organism is different from every other organism. Every organism’s genes are different, too.

Variations

There are variations in the traits of a population. For example, there are lots of variations in the color of human hair.
Hair can be blonde, brown, black, or even red. Hair color is a trait determined by genes.

813

11.4. Adaptation and Evolution of Populations

www.ck12.org

Mutations

At some time in the past, a variation probably came from a mutation. A mutation is a random change in an
organism’s genes ( Figure 11.6). Mutations are natural. Some are harmful, but many are neutral. If a mutation
is harmful, the organism may not live to reproduce. If the mutation is beneﬁcial, that organism may have a better
chance to survive. An organism that survives is likely to have offspring. If it does, it may pass the mutation on to its
offspring. The offspring may be more likely to survive.

FIGURE 11.6
Genetic mutation is central to the creation
of biological diversity.

Adaptations

Some of the characteristics an organism has may help it survive. These characteristics are called adaptations. Some
adaptations are better than others.
Many adaptations protect organisms from the external environment ( Figure 11.7).

FIGURE 11.7
Cacti have thick, water-retaining bodies that help them conserve water.

814

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Life on Earth

Other adaptations help an organism move or gather food. Reindeer have sponge-like hooves that help them walk
on snowy ground without slipping and falling. Fish at the bottom of the ocean are tiny and use very little energy
because there is very little food. Organisms have special features that help them avoid being eaten. Some plants
have poisonous or foul-tasting substances in them that keep animals from eating them. Their brightly colored ﬂowers
serve as a warning. The same is true of some frogs, which can be poisonous ( Figure 11.8)

FIGURE 11.8
Poison dart frogs have toxins in their skin. Their bright colors warn
potential predators not to take a bite!

How Adaptations Develop

Adaptations develop this way. Think about a population of oak trees. Imagine that a fungus has arrived from Asia to
North America. Most of the North American oak trees are killed by the fungus. But a few oak trees have a mutation
that allows them to survive the fungus. Those oak trees are better adapted to the new environment than the others.
Those trees have a better chance of surviving. They will probably reproduce. The trees may pass on the favorable
mutation to their offspring. The other trees will die. Eventually, the population of oak trees will change. Most of the
trees will have the trait to survive the fungus. This is an adaptation. Over time, traits that help an organism survive
become more common. Traits that hinder survival eventually disappear.
Thousands of northern elephant seals—some weighing up to 4,500 pounds—make an annual migration to breed
each winter at Año Nuevo State Reserve in California. Marine biologists are using high-tech tools to explore the
secrets of these amazing creatures.

Summary

• Different members of a population have different genes for the same trait.
• Some of these differences are due to mutations.
• Some traits allow an individual organism to be better adapted to its environment. That individual will be more

likely to survive and to reproduce.

11.5 Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection

• Explain the theory of evolution by natural selection.

How did dark deer mice become lighter over time?
A species changes color over time if its environment changes. Many other types of changes can take place, too.
The darker deer mice evolved into the lighter deer mice in some locations. What do you think changed about the
environment?

Biological Evolution

Adaptations in a species add up over time. These adaptations will mean that many genes have changed. If the
environment is stable, the species won’t change. But if the environment is changing, the species will need to adapt.
Many adaptations may be necessary. In time, the species may change a lot. The descendants will be very different
from their ancestors. They may even become a new species. This process is called biological evolution but is usually
referred to just as evolution.
Organisms alive today evolved from earlier life forms. We can learn about this from fossils. For example, horse
fossils from 60 million years ago are very different from modern horses. Ancient horses were much smaller than
they are today ( Figure 11.9). The horses’ teeth and hooves have also changed. The horses evolved because of
changes in their environment.
Although basic horse evolution appears to be linear, there were many more branches. Horse evolution is very well
understood.

Natural Selection

Evolution happens because of natural selection. Good traits become more common in a population. Bad traits
become less common. The deer mouse, species Peromyscus maniculatus gives an example of evolution by natural
selection. In Nebraska, this mouse is typically brown. But in places where glaciers dropped lighter sand over the
darker soil, the mice are light. Why? Because predators could more easily spot the dark mice on light sand. The
lighter mice were more likely to survive and have offspring. Natural selection favored the light mice. Over time,

FIGURE 11.9
Ancient horses were quite different from
present-day horses.

the population became light colored. Enough changes may take place over time that the two types of mice become
different species.
This story is covered in more detail here: http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/08/mice-living-in-sand-hills-
quickly-evolved-lighter-coloration/ .

Summary

• Changes in the genes of a species may result in a new species. This is biological evolution.
• Natural selection can change a species or even make a new species. Natural processes favor some traits over

others in a population. This causes those traits to be more common in subsequent generations.

• Evolution just means change over time.

11.6 Population Size

• Describe the factors that regulate population size.

How many geese are the right number for this area?
As many as can survive and have healthy offspring! The ﬁgure above shows a ﬂock of snow geese at the Kenai
National Wildlife Refuge. Their population will tend to grow as big as it can for the resources it needs. Once it is
too large, some of its members will die off. This keeps the population size at the right number.

How Populations Grow

A population usually grows when it has what it needs. If there’s plenty of food and other resources, the population
will get bigger. Refer to the table below ( Table 11.1); it shows how a population of bacteria grew. A single bacteria
cell was added to a container of nutrients. Conditions were ideal. The bacteria divided every 30 minutes. After just
10 hours, there were more than a million bacteria! Assume the bacteria population keeps growing at this rate. How
many bacteria will there be at 10.5 hours? Or at 12 hours?

Population Growth Rate

The population growth rate is how fast a population is growing. The letter r stands for the growth rate. The growth
rate equals the number of new members added to the population in a year for each 100 members already in the
population. The growth rate includes new members added to the population and old members removed from the
population. Births add new members to the population. Deaths remove members from the population. The formula
for population growth rate is:
r = b - d, where

b = birth rate (number of births in 1 year per 100 population members)
d = death rate (number of deaths in 1 year per 100 population members)

If the birth rate is greater than the death rate, r is positive. This means that the population is growing bigger. For
example, if b = 10 and d = 8, r = 2. This means that the population is growing by 2 individuals per year for every
100 members of the population. This may not sound like much, but it’s a fairly high rate of growth. A population
growing at this rate would double in size in just 35 years!
If the birth rate is less than the death rate, r is negative. This means that the population is becoming smaller. What
do you think might cause this to happen?

Carrying Capacity

A population can’t keep growing bigger and bigger forever. Sooner or later, it will run out of things it needs. For a
given species, there is a maximum population that can be supported by the environment. This maximum is called
the carrying capacity. When a population gets close to the carrying capacity, it usually grows more slowly ( Figure
11.10). When the population reaches the carrying capacity, it stops growing.

Summary

• A population will grow as long as it has what it needs.
• The carrying capacity of an environment is reached when the number of births equal the number of deaths.
• A limiting factor determines the carrying capacity for a species.

11.7 Extinction and Radiation of Life

• Describe extinction and mass extinction.
• Explain the relationship of adaptive radiation to extinction.

What is next for life on Earth?
Life is dynamic! Species begin, populations grow, species die out, new species are born. Extinction is an important
part of this. If organisms never went extinct, there wouldn’t be any habitats available for new ones to arise. What
could be next?

Extinction

Most of the species that have lived have also gone extinct. There are two ways to go extinct. The most obvious way
is to die out completely. The other way a species goes extinct is if it evolves into a different species. Extinction is a
normal part of Earth’s history. Most of the organisms that have lived have gone extinct.
Sometimes large numbers of species go extinct in a short amount of time. This is a mass extinction. The causes of
different mass extinctions are different: collisions with comets or asteroids, massive volcanic eruptions, or rapidly
changing climate are all possible causes of some of these disasters ( Figure 11.11).

Adaptive Radiation

After a mass extinction, many habitats are no longer inhabited by organisms because they have gone extinct. With
new habitats available, some species will adapt to the new environments. Evolutionary processes act rapidly during
these times. Many new species evolve to ﬁll those available habitats. The process in which many new species evolve
in a short period of time to ﬁll available niches is called adaptive radiation. At the end of this period of rapid

evolution, the life forms do not look much like the ones that were around before the mass extinction. One example
came after the extinction of the dinosaurs. Mammals underwent adaptive radiation and became the dominant life
form. Although they lived in the habitats the dinosaurs had lived in, they didn’t look much like the dinosaurs.

Summary

• Species go extinct when all of the individuals die out or evolve into a different species.
• Many species go extinct at roughly the same time during a mass extinction.
• New habitats become available and species evolve to ﬁll them so that biodiversity increases during adaptive

radiation.

11.8 Growth of Human Populations

• Learn how population size can be limited.
• Describe the growth in human population in the past and projected into the future.

How fast is human population growing?
There are more than 7 billion people in the world. As you read this sentence, at least three more people will be
added. Think about that for second or so, and there’s another three. Why is the human population growing so fast?
Has it always grown this fast? What causes populations to grow?

Human Population Numbers

Bacteria in a dish with ample nutrients double in population until there is no more space. Every population eventually
reaches its maximum size. The population of bacteria in the dish reaches its carrying capacity. The carrying
capacity is the number of an organisms that can live with the resources that are available. The limiting factor for
the bacteria in the dish is space. That’s the factor that limits the population of the bacteria in the dish. If there were
unlimited space then maybe nutrients would be the limiting factor. Some resource will always run out to limit a
population. Let’s now apply these concepts to the human population.
Human population growth over the past 10,000 years has been tremendous ( Figure 11.12). The entire human
population was estimated to be:

• 5 million in 8000 BC
• 300 million in 1 AD
• 1 billion in 1802
• 3 billion in 1961
• 7 billion in 2011

lance/numbers.html .

The Rate of Growth

Not only has the population increased, but the rate of population growth has increased ( Figure 11.13). The
population was estimated to reach 7 billion in 2012, but it did so in 2011. This was just 12 years after reaching
6 billion.

The amount of time between the addi-
tion of each one billion people to the
planet’s population, including speculation
about the future. Already, the population
reached 7 billion one year earlier than
projected.

As the human population continues to grow, different factors limit population in different parts of the world. Space,
clean air, clean water, and food to feed everyone are limiting in some locations. Worldwide though, human ingenuity
has not placed a limit on the population. Not only does the population increase, the rate of population growth
increases.
There is a sign that population growth is slowing. Although population continues to grow rapidly, the rate that the
growth rate is increasing has declined. Still, a recent estimate by the United Nations claims that 10.1 billion people
will be sharing this planet by the end of the century. The total added will be about 3 billion people. That number is
more than were even in existence as recently as 1960. Yet that is much less than the number we would expect if 1
billion people were being added every 12 years.

11.9 Revolutions in Human Population Growth

• Explain what has caused the rises in human population numbers.

Where on the graph are the major population changes?
Let’s look at this graph again. It shows human population from 10,000 BC through 2000 AD. Where are the big
changes in slope of the line? Can you identify them? In this concept, we’ll learn what causes them.

What Causes Human Populations to Grow?

Look at the graph above. Human population increased dramatically at certain times. The graph begins 10,000 BC,
although you can’t really see the line. Population starts to rise perceptibly at around 1800 BC. The numbers begin
to rise dramatically about 200 years ago. What causes these changes?

Agricultural Revolution

Farming was developed about 10,000 years ago. Farming meant a steady supply of food. People could settle in
villages. The rise at around 1800 BC is due to increased farming and the rise of cities and towns. The population
rises steadily until around 1800 AD. At that time it shoots up dramatically. Really dramatically. What happened?

Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution is what happened. The Industrial Revolution began in the late 1700s in Europe, North
America, and a few other places. Before the Industrial Revolution, most labor was done by people. The Industrial
Revolution changed the source of power from humans to fossil fuels. This allowed more work to be done and more
food to be grown. People began to move into cities.

828

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Life on Earth

Where the Industrial Revolution was taking place, the human population started to grow really fast. The birth rate
was always high. What changed was the death rate. The population grew because more people stayed alive. The
death rate fell for several reasons:

1. New farm machines were invented. They increased the amount of food that could be produced. With more

food, people were healthier and could live longer.

2. Steam engines and railroads were built. These machines could quickly carry food long distances. This made

food shortages less likely.

3. Sanitation was improved. Sewers were dug to carry away human wastes ( Figure 11.14). This helped reduce

the spread of disease.

FIGURE 11.14
Digging a London sewer (1840s). Before 1800, human wastes were
thrown into the streets of cities such as London. In the early 1800s, sewers
were dug to carry away the wastes.

With better food and less chance of disease, the death rate fell. More children lived long enough to reach adulthood
and have children of their own. As the death rate fell, the birth rate stayed high for awhile. This caused rapid
population growth.

The Green Revolution

The most recent increase in the slope of the population line is because of another advance in agriculture. The
Green Revolution began in the mid-1900s. The Green Revolution has allowed billions of people to be added to the
population in the past few decades. New methods and products increased how much food could be grown. These
advances include:

• Improving crops by selecting for certain genetic traits. The desired traits promote productivity. Recently,

genetically engineered crops have been introduced.

• Increasing the use of artiﬁcial fertilizers and chemical pesticides.
• Increasing the use of agricultural machinery: plowing, tilling, fertilizing, picking, and transporting. These

machines are powered by fossil fuels, rather than humans.

• Increasing access to water. Many rivers have been dammed. Wells tap into many groundwater aquifers.

The Green Revolution has increased the productivity of farms immensely. A century ago, a single farmer produced
enough food for 2.5 people, but now a farmer can feed more than 130 people. The Green Revolution is credited for
feeding 1 billion people that would not otherwise have been able to live.

The Health Revolution

Health care has been improving over the most recent centuries. Vaccines were developed that could prevent many
diseases ( Figure 11.15). Antibiotics were discovered that could cure most infections caused by bacteria. Together,
these two advances saved countless lives.

Summary

• Farming allowed people to have a steady food source and settle down. The Green Revolution has dramatically

increased agricultural productivity.

• The Industrial Revolution brought new machinery, increased the food supply, and improved sanitation.
• Vaccinations and antibiotics have greatly improved human health.
• With a dramatically lower death rate, human populations have grown.

11.10 Overpopulation and Over-Consumption

• Deﬁne overpopulation and over-consumption.
• Understand the consequences of a large human population on the environment.

Is life the same for all 7 billion of us?
Of course not. A minority of people use most of the world’s energy and other resources. Not only are their needs
met, but they have many luxuries. Many other people lack resources. Many don’t have enough to eat or live, with
the threat of hunger. Many also do not have safe, clean water. Some people live in crowded, run-down housing.
Some people live in mansions.

Overpopulation?

Overpopulation takes place when the number of organisms exceeds the carrying capacity of the region. What is
the carrying capacity of Earth for humans? Are seven billion people the human carrying capacity? Nine billion? We
don’t know yet.
It seems that we have increased the carrying capacity of the planet for humans. We have done this with agriculture
and fossil fuels and improvements in health care. Have we now exceeded Earth’s carrying capacity ( Figure 11.16)?
Are humans on Earth experiencing overpopulation?
There is not yet an answer to that question. So far, many of us have skated along without much trouble. But since
we depend on resources that are non-renewable, the answer could well be yes.

Human Population and the Environment

There is evidence that there are too many of us; that the large population is becoming too high. That’s because we
are harming the environment. Some of the harmful effects of a high human population are:

• Supplying all those people with energy creates a lot of pollution. For example, huge oil spills have killed

millions of living things.

• Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air. This also causes global warming.
• Fossil fuels and other resources are being used up. We may run out of oil by the mid-2000s. Many other

resources will run out sooner or later.

• People are killing too many animals for food. For example, some of the best ﬁshing grounds in the oceans

have almost no ﬁsh left.

831

11.10. Overpopulation and Over-Consumption

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 11.16
Manhattan, one part of New York City, is
one of the most heavily populated regions
in the world.

• People have destroyed many habitats. For example, they’ve drained millions of acres of wetlands. Wetlands

have a great diversity of species. As wetlands shrink, species go extinct.

• People have introduced invasive species - species originally from a different area—to invade new habitats.
The introduction can be intentional or accidental. Often, the aliens have no natural enemies in their new
home. They may drive native species extinct. In the mid-1900s, Australian tree snakes invaded Guam and
other islands in the Paciﬁc. The snakes stowed away on boats and planes. Tree snakes had no natural enemies
on the islands so their population exploded. The snakes have caused the extinction of nine of the eleven native
bird species on Guam ( Figure 11.17).

FIGURE 11.17
A brown tree snake.

• People themselves are also affected by the large size of the human population. Some people have a lot;
some have very little. Many people refer to the abundance of luxury items in some people’s lives as over-
consumption. People in developed nations use 32 times more resources than people in the developing
countries of the world. The symbol of this is CO2 emissions, which are a waste product from fossil fuel
burning. Populations that burn the most fossil fuels have a high standard of living.

Summary

• Supporting 7 billion people is taking an environmental toll on the planet.
• Pollution, habitat destruction, and invasive species are a few of the problems caused by the high population.
• Over-consumption means that some people use a much larger amount of the resources than others.

11.11 Future Human Population Growth

• Describe where human population growth is highest and where it is lowest.
• Understand what will happen to the human population in the future.

Does the world seem crowded?
In some places, there seem to be people everywhere. Times Square in New York City is deﬁnitely one of those
places. In other places, there are hardly any people at all. Does that mean that the world is not overpopulated? Is
space all that people need?

Growth Rates Around the World

With ample food, better health, and easier work, people live longer. Children are much more likely to reach adulthood
and have their own children. In many countries, death rates have gone down dramatically, but birth rates remain high.
This means that the population is growing. Pictured below is the growth rates of human populations all over the world
( Figure 11.19).

FIGURE 11.19
World population growth rates.
Is the
population growing faster in the wealthiest
countries or the poorest countries?

The Future

Human ingenuity has allowed the population to continue to grow. We’ve increased Earth’s carrying capacity for
humans by our genius. We grow crops, trade for needed materials, and design ways to exploit resources that are

834

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Life on Earth

difﬁcult to get at, such as groundwater. We use long-buried ancient organisms for fuel. We have broken the rules for
biological populations.
Of course, there’s a ﬂip side to this. For the population to continue to grow, more advances in agriculture will be
needed. The best lands are already in use. Most rivers that can be dammed, have been dammed. In many aquifers,
groundwater is not replenished on the time frame needed. Fossil fuels too are limited. Obtaining fossil fuels or
developing new power sources will be more costly.

Future Population Growth

The rate of increase of the growth rate of the human population is decreasing ( Figure 11.20). The population may
stop growing by the mid 2000s. Some scientists think that the human population will peak at about 9 billion people.
What will need to change for the population to stop growing then?

FIGURE 11.20
Try to locate on this graph Earth’s carry-
ing capacity for humans. Do you think
this projection is very accurate or just a
guess?

Summary

• Humans have exceeded the carrying capacity of Earth for humans by their ingenuity.
• The rate of population increase is starting to decline. The population is still exploding though.
• The growth rate is higher in less developed nations.

• Explain how sustainable development can work.

Is there another way?
Visibility in Beijing is sometimes so bad that the airport must be closed due to smog. In their rush to develop, many
nations are making the same mistakes that the developed nations have already made. Can everyone ﬁnd a more
sustainable path?

Sustainable Development

Is it possible for all the world’s people to live well and still protect the planet? That’s the aim of sustainable
development. Its goals are to:

1. help people out of poverty.
2. protect the environment.
3. use resources no faster than the rate at which they are regenerated.

A smaller human population is part of the solution. Studies show that educated women have fewer and healthier,
children. Educating women (and men) is a long-term goal of population control.
Developing new technologies can help. For example, ﬁsh farming can feed people good healthy protein. The farming
must be done in an environmentally sound way.
Better use of resources is another part. For example, when forests are logged, new trees should be planted.
Citizens can change their behavior to reduce the impact they have on the planet. They can demand that products are
produced sustainably. People can consume less. They can think about the impact they have when they do consume.
Everyone can help in the effort. What will you do?

Summary

• Sustainable development tries to bring people up to certain minimum living conditions. This must be done

without doing further damage to the environment.

11.13 Biological Communities

• Identify the parts of a biological community.

Where can you ﬁnd an ecosystem?
Just about everywhere you could go in nature, you would be taking a ﬁeld trip to an ecosystem. There are underwater
ecosystems and coastal ecosystems. There are small scale ecosystems and large ones. There are even ecosystems
inside your body!

What Is an Ecosystem?

An ecosystem is a group of living things and their environment. The word ecosystem is short for “ecological
system.” Like any system, an ecosystem is a group of parts that work together. You can see examples of ecosystems
in Figure 11.21. The forest pictured is a big ecosystem. Besides trees, what living things do you think are part of
the forest ecosystem? The dead tree stump in the same forest is a small ecosystem. It includes plants, mosses, and
fungi. It also includes insects and worms.

Abiotic Factors

Abiotic factors are the nonliving parts of ecosystems. They include air, sunlight, soil, water, and minerals. These
are all things that are needed for life. They determine which living things—and how many of them—an ecosystem
can support. Pictured below is an ecosystem and its abiotic factors ( Figure 11.22).

Biotic Factors

Biotic factors are the living parts of ecosystems. They are the species of living things that reside together.

FIGURE 11.21
An ecosystem can be big or small. A
small ecosystem can be part of a larger
ecosystem.

FIGURE 11.22
Which abiotic factors do you see here?

Species, Niche, and Habitat

A species is a unique type of organism. Members of a species can interbreed and produce offspring that can breed
(they are fertile). Organisms that are not in the same species cannot do this. Examples of species include humans,
lions, and redwood trees. Can you name other examples?
Each species has a particular way of making a living. This is called its niche. You can see the niche of a lion below
( Figure 11.23). A lion makes its living by hunting and eating other animals. Each species also has a certain place
where it is best suited to live. This is called its habitat. The lion’s habitat is a grassland. Why is a lion better off in
a grassland than in a forest?

Living Together

All the members of a species that live in the same area form a population. Many different species live together in an
ecosystem. All their populations make up a community. What populations live together in the grassland pictured

Summary

• All of the individuals of a species that exist together at a given place and time make up a population. A

community is made up of all of the populations in an area.

• The living and nonliving factors that living organisms need plus the communities of organisms themselves

make up an ecosystem.

• A habitat is where an organism lives, and a niche is what it does to make a living.

11.14 Roles in an Ecosystem

• Deﬁne and describe the common roles in an ecosystem.

Can you pick out the organisms at the bottom and at the top of this food chain?
What’s at the bottom of the food chain? A bit of the food energy comes from above, where plankton photosynthesize.
Most comes from the coral. Coral are animals that live with tiny zooxanthellae that also photosynthesize. Of course,
you know what’s at the top of this food chain!

Roles in Ecosystems

All ecosystems have living things that play the same basic roles. Some organisms must be producers. Others must
be consumers. Decomposers are also important.

Producers

Producers are living things that use energy to make food. Producers make food for themselves and other living
things. There are two types of producers:

• By far the most common producers use the energy in sunlight to make food. This is called photosynthesis.
Producers that photosynthesize include plants and algae. These organisms must live where there is plenty of
sunlight.

• Other producers use the energy in chemicals to make food. This is called chemosynthesis. Only a very few
producers are of this type, and all of them are microbes. These producers live deep under the ocean where
there is no sunlight. An example is pictured below ( Figure 11.24).

Consumers get their food in different ways ( Figure 11.26). Grazers feed on living organisms without killing them.
A rabbit nibbles on leaves, and a mosquito sucks a drop of blood. Predators, like lions, capture and kill animals
for food. The animals they eat are called prey. Even some plants are consumers. Pitcher plants trap insects in their
sticky ﬂuid in their “pitchers.” The insects are their prey. Scavengers eat animals that are already dead. This hyena
is eating the remains of a lion’s prey. Decomposers break down dead organisms and the wastes of living things (
Figure 11.26). This dung beetle is rolling a ball of dung (animal waste) back to its nest. The beetle will use the
dung to feed its young. The mushrooms pictured are growing on a dead log. They will slowly break it down. This
releases its nutrients to the soil.

Summary

• Herbivores eat plants, carnivores eat meat, and omnivores eat both.
• Predators are animals that eat a prey animal. Scavengers eat organisms that are already dead. Decomposers

break down dead plants and animals into component parts, including nutrients.

11.15 Flow of Energy in Ecosystems

• Describe food chains and webs.
• Explain how energy ﬂows through ecosystems.

What is the source of energy for almost all ecosystems?
The Sun supports most of Earth’s ecosystems. Plants create chemical energy from abiotic factors that include solar
energy. The food energy created by producers is passed through the food chain.

How Energy Flows Through Ecosystems

All living things need energy. They need it to power the processes of life. For example, it takes energy to grow. It
also takes energy to produce offspring. In fact, it takes energy just to stay alive. Remember that energy can’t be
created or destroyed. It can only change form. Energy changes form as it moves through ecosystems.

The Flow of Energy

Most ecosystems get their energy from the Sun. Only producers can use sunlight to make usable energy. Producers
convert the sunlight into chemical energy or food. Consumers get some of that energy when they eat producers.
They also pass some of the energy on to other consumers when they are eaten. In this way, energy ﬂows from one
living thing to another.

847

11.15. Flow of Energy in Ecosystems

www.ck12.org

Food Chains

A food chain is a simple diagram that shows one way energy ﬂows through an ecosystem. Pictured below is an
example of a food chain ( Figure 11.27). Producers form the base of all food chains. The consumers that eat
producers are called primary consumers. The consumers that eat primary consumers are secondary consumers. This
chain can continue to multiple levels.

FIGURE 11.27
What do the arrows stand for in a food
chain?

At each level of a food chain, a lot of energy is lost. Only about ten percent of the energy passes to the next level.
Where does that energy go? Some energy is given off as heat. Some energy goes into animal wastes. Energy also
goes into growing things that another consumer can’t eat, like fur. It’s because so much energy is lost that most food
chains have just a few levels. There’s not enough energy left for higher levels.

Food Webs

Food chains are too simple to represent the real world. They don’t show all the ways that energy ﬂows through an
ecosystem. A more complex diagram is called a food web ( Figure 11.28). A food web consists of many overlapping
food chains. Can you identify the food chains in the ﬁgure? How many food chains include the mouse?
Food webs also overlap. For example, an eagle is part of a land food web. But it might go to the sea to grab a ﬁsh.
That ﬁsh is part of a marine food web.

Summary

• A food chain describes the passage of energy.
• A food web is a set of interconnected and overlapping food chains.
• Food webs are interconnected.

11.16 Flow of Matter in Ecosystems

• Describe how matter ﬂows through ecosystems.

What happens when you don’t get enough of a nutrient?
Millions of sailors in the 15th through 18th centuries died mysteriously. They developed a disease called scurvy.
The scurvy, it turns out, was due to the lack of vitamin C in their diets. It wasn’t until 1932 that the link between
scurvy and vitamin C was made. Without the right nutrients in the right amounts, you can’t live. Other animals and
plants also need the right nutrients to live.

How Matter Moves Through Ecosystems

Living things need nonliving matter as well as energy. What do you think matter is used for? It’s used to build
bodies. It’s also needed to carry out the processes of life. Any nonliving matter that living things need is called a
nutrient. Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. In the
ﬁgure below, you can see how ( Figure 11.29).

• Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms.
• The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots.
• The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants.
• The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers.
• When living things die, the cycle repeats.

Summary

• Nutrients are crucial to the growth of organisms.

have to be added. Can you explain why?

11.17 Nitrogen Cycle in Ecosystems

• Describe nitrogen’s roles as a nutrient.
• Deﬁne nitrogen ﬁxation, and explain how it occurs.

Why are these ﬁsh dead?
In a dead zone, there is so little oxygen that ﬁsh can’t live. What causes the oxygen to disappear? Indirectly, it’s
nitrogen.

The Nitrogen Cycle

Living things need nitrogen. Nitrogen is a key element in proteins. Like carbon, nitrogen cycles through ecosystems.
The nitrogen cycle is pictured below ( Figure 11.30).

Fixing Nitrogen

Air is about 78 percent nitrogen. Decomposers release nitrogen into the air from dead organisms and their wastes.
However, producers such as plants can’t use these forms of nitrogen. Nitrogen must combine with other elements
before producers can use it. This is done by certain bacteria in the soil. It’s called “ﬁxing” nitrogen.

Human Actions and the Nitrogen Cycle

Nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients needed by plants. That’s why most plant fertilizers contain nitrogen.
Adding fertilizer to soil allows more plants to grow. As a result, a given amount of land can produce more food. So
far, so good. But what happens next?

854

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Life on Earth

FIGURE 11.30
The nitrogen cycle includes air, soil, and
living things.

Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to
oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control.
Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure 11.31). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the
algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This
creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little
oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure 11.31). The U.S. states outlined on the map have
rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from
these areas into the Gulf.

Summary

• Nitrogen is an essential part of many molecules needed by living organisms.
• Nitrogen is ﬁxed when it is changed into a form that organisms can use.
• Dead zones come about when excess nitrogen in the water causes algae to grow out of control. Decomposers
use oxygen to decompose the algae when they die. The lack of oxygen makes it impossible for other organisms
to live in that zone.

11.18 Fresh Water Ecosystems

• Describe the various types of freshwater ecosystems.

What do the swamps of Florida look like?
Orlando, Florida is home to many amusement parks. On the left is a swamp with swamp wildlife. On the right is
the village of Hogsmeade, or at least a replica. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is one of the many amusement
parks in and around Orlando. These amusement parks are built on land that was mostly lakes and swamps.

Freshwater Ecosystems

Lakes, ponds, streams, springs, and wetlands are fresh water bodies. The organisms that live in them are part of
freshwater ecosystems. These ecosystems vary by temperature, pressure (in lakes), and the amount of light that
penetrates. The type of plants that grow in these ecosystems varies.

Lake Ecosystems

Limnology is the study of the plants and animals that live in fresh water bodies. A lake has zones just like the ocean.
The ecosystem of a lake is divided into three distinct zones ( Figure 11.32):

1. The surface (littoral) zone is the sloped area closest to the edge of the water.
2. The open-water zone (also called the photic zone) has sunlight.
3. The deep-water zone (also called the aphotic zone) has little or no sunlight.

There are several life zones found within a lake:

• In the littoral zone, sunlight allows plants to grow. Plants provide food and shelter to animals such as snails,

insects, and ﬁsh.

• Other plants and ﬁsh live in the open-water zone. These include bass and trout.
• The deep-water zone is dark so there is no photosynthesis. Most deep-water organisms are scavengers. They
feed on dead organisms that fall to the bottom of the lake. Crabs and catﬁsh are two of these types of organisms.
Fungi and bacteria are decomposers that live in the deep zone.

858

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Life on Earth

FIGURE 11.32
The three primary zones of a lake are
the littoral, open-water, and deep-water
zones.

Wetlands

Some of Earth’s freshwater is found in wetlands. A wetland is an area that is covered with water, or at least has very
soggy soil, during all or part of the year. Certain species of plants thrive in wetlands, and they are rich ecosystems.
Freshwater wetlands are usually found at the edges of streams, rivers, ponds, or lakes. Wetlands can also be found
at the edges of seas.

Types of Freshwater Wetlands

Not all wetlands are alike, as you can see below ( Figure 11.33). Wetlands vary in how wet they are and how much
of the year they are soaked. Wetlands also vary in the kinds of plants that live in them. This depends mostly on the
climate where the wetland is found. Types of wetlands include marshes, swamps, and bogs.

• A marsh is a wetland that is usually under water. It has grassy plants, such as cattails.
• A swamp is a wetland that may or may not be covered with water but is always soggy. It has shrubs or trees.
• A bog is a wetland that has soggy soil. It is generally covered with mosses.

FIGURE 11.33
These are just three of many types of wetlands.

859

11.18. Fresh Water Ecosystems

Importance of Wetlands

www.ck12.org

People used to think that wetlands were useless. Many wetlands were ﬁlled in with rocks and soil to create solid
land. This land was then developed with roads, golf courses, and buildings. Now we know that wetlands are very
important. Laws have been passed to help protect them. Why are wetlands so important?

• Wetlands have great biodiversity. They provide homes or breeding sites to a huge variety of species. Because

so much wetland area has been lost, many of these species are endangered.

• Wetlands purify water. They ﬁlter sediments and toxins from runoff before it enters rivers, lakes, and oceans.
• Wetlands slow rushing water. During hurricanes and other extreme weather, wetlands reduce the risk of ﬂoods.

Although the rate of loss has slowed, wetlands are still being destroyed today.

Summary

• The conditions that affect lake ecosystems are similar to those that affect ocean ecosystems. These include

light penetration, temperature, and water depth.

• Wetlands are lands that are wet for a signiﬁcant portion of the year.
• Wetlands are extremely important as an ecosystem and as a ﬁlter for pollutants.

11.19 Types of Marine Organisms

• Describe types of marine organisms.

How can you visit marine life?
It’s easiest to get to the relatively shallow seaﬂoor just offshore. Experienced divers can descend to 130 feet (43 ft),
which gives them access to most marine life. Manned submersibles can descend to the bottom of the deep ocean.
Where would you like to go? A coral reef or a hydrothermal vent?

Living Things in the Ocean

Marine organisms range in size from tiny bacteria to the largest known animal, the blue whale. All are adapted for
life in salt water. Most are adapted for extreme pressures.
When you think of life in the ocean, do you think of ﬁsh? Actually, ﬁsh are not the most common life forms in the
ocean. Plankton are the most common. Plankton make up one of three major groups of marine life. The other two
groups are nekton and benthos ( Figure 11.34).

FIGURE 11.34
Living things in the oceans are placed in these three groups.

861

11.19. Types of Marine Organisms

www.ck12.org

Plankton

Plankton are living things that ﬂoat in the water. Most plankton are too small to see with the unaided eye ( Figure
11.35). Plankton are unable to move on their own. Ocean motions carry them along.
There are two main types of plankton:

1. Phytoplankton are “plant-like” plankton. Since they make food by photosynthesis, they live in the photic

zone. Most are algae.

2. Zooplankton are “animal-like” plankton that include tiny animals and ﬁsh larvae. They feed on phytoplank-

ton.

FIGURE 11.35
The phytoplankton (left) and zooplankton
(right) shown here have been magniﬁed.
Otherwise, they would be too small for you
to see.

Nekton

Nekton are living things that swim through the water ( Figure 11.36). They may live at any depth, in the photic or
aphotic zone. Most nekton are ﬁsh, although some are mammals. Fish have ﬁns and streamlined bodies to help them
swim. Fish also have gills to take oxygen from the water.

FIGURE 11.36
Nekton swim through ocean water.

Benthos

Benthos are living organisms on the ocean ﬂoor. Many benthic organisms attach themselves to rocks and stay in
one place. This protects them from crashing waves and other water movements. Some benthic organisms burrow
into sediments for food or protection. Benthic animals may crawl over the ocean ﬂoor. Examples of benthos include
clams and worms. Pictured below are two other examples ( Figure 11.37).

862

www.ck12.org

Chapter 11. Life on Earth

FIGURE 11.37
These animals live on the ocean ﬂoor.

Some benthos live near vents on the deep ocean ﬂoor. Tubeworms are an example ( Figure 11.38). Scalding hot
water pours out of the vents. The hot water contains chemicals that some specialized bacteria can use to make food.
Tubeworms have the bacteria living inside them. The bacteria get protection and the tubeworms get some of the
food.

FIGURE 11.38
Tubeworms live near hot water vents on the deep ocean ﬂoor.

Summary

• Plankton are tiny organisms that are swept along on currents. Phytoplankton are tiny plant-like organisms.

Zooplankton are tiny animals.

• Nekton are organisms that go through the water under their own power. Fish and marine mammals are nekton.
• Benthos bury in the sediment, attach to rocks, or crawl over the seaﬂoor.

11.20 Marine Food Chains

• Understand where the food energy comes from for marine food chains.

What’s the most unusual life form you could see on Earth?
Some people might disagree. But the most unusual life on Earth could be the strange organisms that live at
hydrothermal vents at mid-ocean ridges. These organisms break down chemicals to make food energy. They engage
in chemosynthesis. Would you like to see an ecosystem with chemosynthesis at its base?

Marine Food Chains

Pictured below is a marine food chain ( Figure 11.39). Phytoplankton form the base of the food chain. Phyto-
plankton are the most important primary producers in the ocean. They use sunlight and nutrients to make food by
photosynthesis. Small zooplankton consume phytoplankton. Larger organisms eat the small zooplankton. Larger
predators eat these consumers. In an unusual relationship, some enormous whales depend on plankton for their food.
They ﬁlter tremendous amounts of these tiny creatures out of the water.
The bacteria that make food from chemicals are also primary producers. These organisms do not do photosynthesis
since there is no light at the vents. They do something called chemosynthesis. They break down chemicals to make
food.
When marine organisms die, decomposers break them down. This returns their nutrients to the water. The nutrients
can be used again to make food. Decomposers in the oceans include bacteria and worms. Many live on the ocean
ﬂoor. Do you know why?

Summary

• Photosynthesis is the base of nearly all food chains on Earth. This is true of marine food chains, too.
• In chemosynthesis, organisms break down chemicals to make food energy.
• As on land, marine decomposers break down dead organisms. They release nutrients.

11.21 Ocean Ecosystems

• Describe the various types of ocean ecosystems.

What would a ﬁeld trip into the ocean reveal?
There are all sorts of incredible life forms in the seas! Most live near the surface or come up to the surface. Some
live very far below the surface and never come up. All are well adapted to their watery environment.

The Intertidal

Have you been to a rocky shore and seen the intertidal? It’s the zone at the beach that is covered when the tide is up
and uncovered when the tide is out. An abundance of life is found there, but it’s a difﬁcult place to live. Conditions
change rapidly. Waves pound and the tide goes in and out ( Figure 11.40).
Many animals in the intertidal live in tide pools. What speciﬁc adaptations do they have to that zone? The mussels
on the top left have hard shells. These protect them from waves and from drying out. The sea anemones in the
lower right are more often submerged. They can close up during low tides. Both types of organisms have strong
attachments so they don’t wash out to sea.
Many young organisms get their start in estuaries and so they must be adapted to rapid shifts in salinity.

FIGURE 11.40
Organisms in a tide pool include a sea star and a sea urchin.

Reefs

Corals and other animals create limestone rock reefs near the shore. Coral reefs are the “rainforests of the oceans.”
They have a tremendous amount of species diversity ( Figure 11.41).

FIGURE 11.41
Coral reefs are very beautiful and very diverse.

Reefs can form interesting shapes in the oceans. Remember that there are many volcanoes in the ocean. Coral reefs
can form on volcanoes in tropical water. Since the volcanoes are cones, the reef forms in a circle around the volcano.
Eventually the volcano becomes inactive. The mountain subsides and erodes so that it is below sea level. This leaves
a circular coral reef ( Figure 11.42).

FIGURE 11.42
In this image of Maupiti Island in the South Paciﬁc, the remnants of the
volcano are surrounded by the circular reef.

Eventually, all that is left is a reef island called an atoll. A lagoon is found inside the reef.

Oceanic Zone

The open ocean is a vast area. Food washes down from the land. Food is also created by photosynthesizing plankton.
Zooplankton and larger animals feed on the phytoplankton and on each other. Larger animals such as whales and
giant groupers may live their entire lives in the open water.
In the deepest ocean, survival is almost impossible ( Figure 11.43). It’s very rare to ﬁnd a meal, so the ﬁsh there
use very little energy. They are very small. The ﬁsh move very little and breathe slowly. Missing a meal could be

a larger ﬁsh. Some have backward-folding teeth to keep prey from escaping.

Hydrothermal Vents

Hydrothermal vents are among the most unusual ecosystems on Earth. They are located at mid-ocean ridges where
water is extremely hot. The food source for these ecosystems is chemosynthesis ( Figure 11.44). This ecosystem is
entirely separate from the photosynthesis at the surface. Shrimp, clams, ﬁsh, and giant tube worms have been found
in these extreme places.

11.22 Evolution of Simple Cells

• Describe how life began.
• Outline the importance of cyanobacteria in early Earth history.

What would you see if you could go back 4.5 billion years?
If you took a ﬁeld trip back in time to the earliest Earth, things would be very different. Everything would be very
hot. What company would you have? Maybe some simple microbes. Maybe not.

Ancient Life

For the ﬁrst 4 billion years of Earth history there is only a little evidence of life. Organisms were tiny and soft and
did not fossilize well. But scientists use a variety of ways to ﬁgure out what this early life was like. Note that the
period from Earth’s origin to the beginning of the Phanerozoic is called the Precambrian.

Life Begins

Life probably began in the oceans. No one knows exactly how or when. Life may have originated more than once.
If life began before the Moon formed, that impact would have wiped it out. Then life would have had to originate
again. Eventually conditions on Earth became less violent. The planet could support life.
The ﬁrst organisms were made of only one cell ( Figure 11.45). The earliest cells were prokaryotes. Prokaryotic
cells are surrounded by a cell membrane. They do not have a nucleus. Their organelles are free in the cell. The cells
get their nutrients directly from the water they live in. The cells need to use these nutrients to live and grow.

871

11.22. Evolution of Simple Cells

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 11.45
E. coli (Escherichia coli) is a primitive prokaryote that may resemble the
earliest cells.

The cells also needed to be able to make copies of themselves. To do this they stored genetic information in nucleic
acids. The two nucleic acids are DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). Nucleic acids pass
genetic instructions to the next generation.

Oxygen Enters the Atmosphere

Early cells took nutrients from the water. Eventually the nutrients would have become less abundant.
Around 3 billion years ago, photosynthesis began. Organisms could make their own food from sunlight and inorganic
molecules. From these ingredients they made chemical energy that they used. Oxygen is a waste product of
photosynthesis. That ﬁrst oxygen combined with iron to create iron oxide. As more oxygen was produced, the
gas entered the atmosphere.
Some of the oxygen in the atmosphere became ozone. The ozone layer formed to protect Earth from harmful
ultraviolet radiation. This made the environment able to support more complex life forms.

Early Organisms

The ﬁrst organisms to photosynthesize were cyanobacteria. These organisms may have been around as far back as
3.5 billion years. Cyanobacteria are still alive today ( Figure 11.46). Now they are called blue-green algae. They
are common in lakes and seas, and they account for 20% to 30% of photosynthesis today.

Summary

Chapter 11. Life on Earth

• A prokaryote has a cell membrane but otherwise organelles are loose within the cell.
• Photosynthesis allows organisms to produce food energy with oxygen as a by-product. After photosynthesis
evolved, iron oxidized and then oxygen entered the atmosphere. Ozone was created in the upper atmosphere.

• Cyanobacteria, which are still around today, were the earliest known photosynthesizing organisms.

11.23 Evolution of Eukaryotes to Multicellular

Life

• Describe key developments in the evolution of eukaryotes.
• Outline the evolution of multicellular organisms.

If you could go back to the late Precambrian, would you recognize these as ancestors of modern life?
This is a depiction of Dickinsonia costata, a member of the Ediacara fauna. No one knows quite how to categorize
these organisms. Some scientists think that they are the ancestors of modern life. But most scientists believe that the
Ediacara fauna died out and that other organisms were the ancestors of modern life. If you could go back in time
maybe you could ﬁgure it out. But since that isn’t possible, is there any way to really know?

Life Gets More Complex

Eukaryotes evolved about 2 billion years ago. Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have a cell nucleus. They have more
structures and are better organized. Organelles within a eukaryote can perform certain functions. Some supply
energy; some break down wastes. Eukaryotes were better able to live and so became the dominant life form. You
can see an example of a eukaryotic cell below ( Figure 11.47).

Multicellular Life Originates

For life to become even more complex, multicellular organisms needed to evolve. Prokaryotes and eukaryotes can
be multicellular.
Toward the end of the Precambrian, the Ediacara fauna evolved ( Figure 11.48). The Ediacara fauna was extremely
diverse. The organisms appeared after Earth defrosted from a worldwide glaciation. The Ediacara fauna seems to
have died out without leaving descendants. Other multicellular organisms appeared in the Phanerozoic.

FIGURE 11.48
A fossil of an Ediacara organism.

Summary

• Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus. They also have well-developed structures.
• Eukaryotes did not evolve until 2 billion years ago.
• Ediacara organisms probably went extinct. Other organisms were the ancestors to modern life.

11.24 Life of the Phanerozoic Eon

• Describe the evolution of life in the Phanerozoic Eon.

Does this look like the Earth you know?
It’s not hard to take a ﬁeld trip to see some ancient life. Horseshoe crabs live along the east coast of the United States
and elsewhere. These ancient creatures have been more-or-less unchanged for the past 450 million years. This is
indicated by fossils. That doesn’t get them quite back to the beginning of the Paleozoic but close. So hundreds of
millions of generations of horseshoe crabs have seen most of the Phanerozoic go by.

Phanerozoic Eon

The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three eras—the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, and the Cenozoic ( Figure (11.2).
They span from about 540 million years ago to the present. We live now in the Cenozoic Era.
Earth’s climate changed numerous times during the Phanerozoic Eon. At the end of the Precambrian, much of the
planet was covered with glaciers. At the start of the Phanerozoic Eon, the climate became warm and humid. Since
then Earth’s climate has gone through four cycles of frigid glaciers and warm tropical seas. Some organisms survive
changes in the climate. Others go extinct when the climate changes too much.

Phanerozoic Time Line

The table below ( Table 11.2) shows some of the life forms that developed during the Phanerozoic Eon. Life
gradually became more diverse and new species appeared. Most modern organisms evolved from species that are
now extinct.

• Learn about the mass extinction that ended the Paleozoic.

Okay, so you wouldn’t recognize the Precambrian. How about the Paleozoic?
Probably not. You’d see things like these bizarre animals. The creature on the left is much like a large arthropod.
The creature on the right had ﬁve eyes, and a long nose like a vacuum cleaner hose. These creatures were found as
fossils in the Burgess shale.

Paleozoic Era

The ﬁrst period of the Paleozoic Era was the Cambrian. By the beginning of the Paleozoic, organisms evolved shells.
Shells could hold their soft tissues together. Shells could protect them from predators and from drying out. Some
organisms evolved external skeletons. These are called exoskeletons. Organisms with hard parts also make good
fossils. Fossils from the Cambrian are much more abundant than fossils from the Precambrian.

The Cambrian Explosion

The warm, humid climate of the early Cambrian was good for life. There was a tremendous increase in diversity.
There was also an amazing increase in the number of living things. For these two reasons, this time period is called
the Cambrian Explosion.
With so much diversity, complex ecosystems could develop. All of this life was in the seas.

879

11.25. History of Paleozoic Life

The Paleozoic Continues

www.ck12.org

Paleozoic seas were full of worms, snails, clams, trilobites, sponges, and brachiopods. Organisms with shells were
common.
The ﬁrst ﬁsh were simple, armored, jawless ﬁsh. Fish have internal skeletons. Some, like sharks, skates, and
rays, have skeletons of cartilage. More advanced ﬁsh have skeletons of bones. Fish evolved jaws and many other
adaptations for ocean life. Pictured below is some of the diversity of Earth’s oceans ( Figure 11.49).

FIGURE 11.49
Mudskippers are ﬁsh that are able to walk short distances.

Moving onto Land

An organism that lives in water is supported by the water. It does not need strong support structures. It also does
not need to be protected against drying out. This is not true of land. Moving from the seas to land required many
adaptations.
Algae had covered moist land areas for millions of years. By about 450 million years ago, plants began to appear
on land. Once there were land plants, animals had a source of food and shelter. To move to land, animals needed
strong skeletons. They needed protection from drying out. They needed to be able to breathe air. Eventually they
had skeletons, lungs, and the other the adaptations they needed moved onto the land.

Mass Extinctions

Chapter 11. Life on Earth

The eras of the Phanerozoic Eon are separated by mass extinctions. During these events, large numbers of organisms
became extinct very rapidly. There have been several extinctions in the Phanerozoic. Two mass extinctions stand out
more than the others. One took place at the end of the Paleozoic. The other took place at the end of the Mesozoic.

Permian Extinction

Between the Paleozoic Era and the Mesozoic Era was the largest mass extinction known. At the end of the Permian,
nearly 95% of all marine species died off. In addition, 70% of land species became extinct. No one knows the
cause of this extinction. Some scientists blame an asteroid impact. Other scientists think it was a gigantic volcanic
eruption. It is possible that multiple things went wrong for life at the same time. The environment was changing, an
asteroid impacted, and a giant volcanic eruption took place.

Summary

• In the Cambrian there was an explosion of life. This explosion was in number and in diversity.
• At the beginning of the Paleozoic, all life was in the seas. Later in the Paleozoic, life colonized the land.
• To colonize land, animals need to be able to keep themselves together. They need to keep from drying out.

They need to be able to breathe air.

• At the end of the Permian was the largest known extinction in Earth history.

11.26 History of Mesozoic Life

• Describe the diversiﬁcation of life during the Mesozoic.
• Learn about the mass extinction that ended the Mesozoic.

Would Mesozoic Earth look familiar?
The Precambrian and Paleozoic Earth would probably not be recognizable. How about if you visited the Mesozoic?
The planet would look a lot more like it does today. Animals would ﬁll the niches you’re used to seeing animals ﬁll.
But the animals would be mostly reptiles. So things wouldn’t be so familiar after all.

The Mesozoic Era

The Paleozoic ended with a mass extinction. This left lots of habitats available for new organisms. Adaptive radiation
by reptiles ﬁlled these habitats. The Mesozoic Era was the age of reptiles. The planet was generally warmer than it
is now. This climate was very good for reptiles.
Reptiles developed adaptations for living away from water. Their thick skin keeps them from drying out. The
evolution of the amniote egg allowed them to lay their eggs on dry land. The amniote egg has a shell and contains
all the nutrients and water required for the developing embryo ( Figure 11.51).

Dinosaurs

Earth in the Mesozoic was populated by an enormous diversity of reptiles. Most of the reptiles were dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs reigned the planet for 160 million years. They had tremendous numbers and diversity. Some were small
and some were very large ( Figure 11.52). Some were peaceful plant eaters. Some were extremely frightening

meat eaters. Some dinosaurs developed protection, such as horns, spikes, tail clubs, and shielding plates. These
adaptations were defense against active predators.
Species of dinosaurs ﬁlled all the niches that are currently ﬁlled by mammals. Most dinosaurs lived on land. Still,
pterosaurs ﬂew the skies. Plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs swam in the oceans ( Figure 11.53). Feathered dinosaurs
gave rise to birds.

FIGURE 11.52
Some examples of Mesozoic dinosaurs include this Tyrannosaurus Rex,
pictured with two Gallimimus.

Scientists now think that some dinosaurs were endotherms (warm-blooded). There is a lot of evidence for this
hypothesis. Some dinosaurs lived in very cold regions. Many dinosaurs grew fast and were very active. Dinosaur
bones had canals, like birds. Some dinosaurs stood upright and had big brains. These features are more typical of
endotherms.
An interesting look at the points for dinosaur endothermy is seen here: http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/en
dothermy.html .

FIGURE 11.53

Plants also did well in the Mesozoic. Lush forests covered the land. Flowering plants evolved later in the Mesozoic.

Mammals appeared near the end of the Triassic.

Cretaceous Extinction

Chapter 11. Life on Earth

The most famous mass extinction was 65 million years ago. Between the Mesozoic Era and the Cenozoic Era, about
50% of all animal species died off. This mass extinction is when the dinosaurs became extinct. Most scientists
think that the extinction was caused by a giant meteorite that struck Earth. The impact heated the atmosphere until
it became as hot as a kitchen oven. Animals roasted. Dust ﬂew into the atmosphere and blocked sunlight for a
year or more. This caused a deep freeze and ended photosynthesis. Sulfur from the impact mixed with water in the
atmosphere. The result was acid rain. The rain dissolved the shells of the tiny marine plankton that form the base of
the food chain. With little food being produced, animals starved.

Summary

• The amniote egg allowed reptiles to move away from water.
• In the Mesozoic, dinosaurs ﬁlled the niches that mammals ﬁll today.
• About half of the life forms of the Mesozoic appear to have gone extinct due to a giant asteroid impact.

11.27 History of Cenozoic Life

• Describe the diversiﬁcation of life during the Cenozoic.

Do these animals look familiar?
The ice ages were very recent as Earth history goes. The animals are familiar, but they’re still very different from
modern ones. For one thing, most of them were huge. A small surface area-to-volume ratio is better for keeping
warm (less surface to lose heat from). Although the dominant animals were mammals, the Pleistocene Earth still
does not look quite modern.

The Cenozoic Era

The Cenozoic Era is going on right now! It is the age of mammals. The Cenozoic began with the extinction of every
land creature larger than a dog. This left many niches open. Organisms evolved to ﬁll them.
There was a huge radiation of mammals. But birds, like the few seen in the pictures ( Figure 11.54), are more
common and even more diverse. Both mammals and birds have the ability to regulate their own body temperature.
They are endotherms (warm blooded). This was an advantage since Earth’s climate went through sudden and
dramatic changes.

FIGURE 11.54
Left: A pelican, catching a ﬁsh. Center: A hummingbird, taking a sip from
a ﬂower. Right: A falcon, ready to catch its prey.

Diversiﬁcation of the Mammals

Mammals have adapted to all sorts of different environments. They were able to spread to even more environments
than the reptiles. Mammals are endothermic and have fur, hair, or blubber for warmth. Mammals can walk, swim, or
ﬂy. They can live in nearly all terrestrial environments. Mammals initially ﬁlled the forests that covered many early
Cenozoic lands. When grasslands arose, mammals evolved to ﬁll those niches too. You can see pictures of many
different mammals below ( Figure 11.55).

Lions, tigers, wolves, and, later, humans, hunt the herds on their summer migration.This was the San Francisco Bay
Area at the close of the last ice age.

Summary

• With the extinction of the dinosaurs, niches were open for birds and mammals to ﬁll.
• Birds and mammals are endotherms. Both are diverse and abundant.
• Many of the organisms of the Pleistocene ice ages were enormous. Animals with a low surface area to body

ratio are better able to keep warm.

• Many of the Pleistocene megafauna have gone extinct.

11.28 Human Evolution

• Identify and describe key developments in human evolution.

What is a "cave man"?
What if you were to wake up with a group of Neanderthals? They were close relatives to modern humans. Still you
might ﬁnd them to be a bit different from your usual friends.

Human Evolution

Humans evolved during the later Cenozoic. New fossil discoveries continue to alter the details of what we know
about human evolution. The major evolutionary events are well understood though.

Primate Ancestors

Chapter 11. Life on Earth

Humans evolved from primates, a group of mammals that includes lemurs, monkeys and apes. Humans are part of
the apes, but we did not evolve from apes, which also include chimpanzees and gorillas. Apes and humans have a
primate common ancestor. About 5 to 7 million years ago, chimpanzees (our closest living relatives) and humans
shared their last common ancestor.

Hominids

Animals of the genus, Ardipithecus lived roughly 4 to 6 million years ago. These animals had brains roughly the
size of a female chimp. Although they lived in trees, they were bipedal. That is, they could stand on two feet. What
are the advantages to being bipedal? An organism that can stand up can see farther. This is important if you live in
a grassland. A bipedal organism uses its hands and arms for hunting.
Another human ancestor, Australopithecus afarensis lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago ( Figure 11.57).
These animals were completely bipedal. Their brains grew rapidly across the generations.

FIGURE 11.57
Australopithecus afarensis is a human ancestor that lived about 3 million
years ago.

The genus Homo, which has modern humans as its only living species, appeared about 2.5 million years ago. These
human-like primates developed the ﬁrst stone tools. Homo erectus evolved in Africa about 1.8 million years ago.
Fossils of these animals show a much more human-like body structure. This allowed them to travel long distances
to hunt. Cultures began and evolved.

Homo sapiens is our species. We originated about 200,000 years ago in Africa. Evidence of a spiritual life appears
about 32,000 years ago. The evidence includes stone ﬁgurines that probably have religious signiﬁcance ( Figure

891

11.28. Human Evolution

11.58).

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 11.58
Stone ﬁgurines likely indicate a spiritual life.

The ice ages allowed humans to migrate. During the ice ages, water was frozen in glaciers. Land bridges such as the
Bering Strait allowed humans to walk from the Old World to the New World.

Summary

• Australopithecus afarensis was completely bipedal and had a growing brain.
• Homo erectus evolved 1.8 million years ago. These organisms left behind signs of an early culture.
• Our species is Homo sapiens. We evolved 200,000 years ago in Africa, and spread.

11.29 Life and the Geologic Time Scale

• Observe the relationship of the evolution of life to geologic time.

Does this look more like geologic time?
This image gives some sense of what life forms appeared when. Take a good look. It’s pretty amazing!

Life and the Geologic Time Scale

The geologic time scale may include illustrations of how life on Earth has changed. Major events on Earth may also
be shown. These include the formation of the major mountains or the extinction of the dinosaurs. The ﬁgure above
is a different kind of the geologic time scale. It shows how Earth’s environment and life forms have changed.

Your Place in Geologic Time

We now live in the Phanerozoic Eon, the Cenozoic Era, the Quarternary Period, and the Holocene Epoch. Phanero-
zoic means visible life. During this eon, rocks contain visible fossils. Before the Phanerozoic, life was microscopic.
The Cenozoic Era means new life.
It encompasses the most recent forms of life on Earth. The Cenozoic is
sometimes called the Age of Mammals. Before the Cenozoic came the Mesozoic and Paleozoic. The Mesozoic
means middle life. This is the age of reptiles, when dinosaurs ruled the planet. The Paleozoic is old life. Organisms
like invertebrates and ﬁsh were the most common lifeforms.

894

Chapter 11. Life on Earth

The Quaternary Period is the time since the beginning of the ice ages. The climate has been cooler than it was earlier
in the Cenozoic. Since the end of the Pleistocene ice ages, which are probably not entirely over, we have been in the
Holocene Epoch. The Holocene is also called the Recent.

Summary

• Complex life forms evolved relatively late in geologic time.
• The Holocene is a teeny part of Earth history. Humans evolved very recently.
• The last 540 million years has seen an incredible amount of biodiversity.

Summary

Modern life is so diverse! Plants are found in the oceans and all over the land. Plants can have a single cell. They
can be giant trees. Animals are also extremely diverse. They can also be very different in size, from a single cell
to the largest animal that ever lived—a blue whale! Animals and plants live as part of ecosystems. Ecosystems are
different from each other but they have organisms playing nearly all the same roles. There must be a source of food
energy. For most life on Earth food energy comes directly or indirectly from photosynthesis. Feeding from plants are
herbivores, and from herbivores are carnivores. There are predators, scavengers, and decomposers, among others,
to ﬁll out the ecosystem. Energy ﬂows through the ecosystems. The connections between organisms are made in a

11.29. Life and the Geologic Time Scale

www.ck12.org

web. This is known as the food web. There are many types of ecosystems in fresh water, the oceans, and on land.
Organisms must be well adapted to their habitats or they may go extinct. Extinction of a species opens up a niche. A
new and possibly different species will evolve to ﬁll that niche. This has occurred throughout Earth’s history. Mass
extinctions have opened habitats. New organisms have evolved to ﬁll those habitats. The earliest life was simple
cells. Photosynthesis evolved and provided a food source for the food web. Photosynthesis also supplied oxygen to
the atmosphere. Multicellular life didn’t evolve for 4 billion years. During most of the Paleozoic, life was restricted
to the seas. Reptiles, especially dinosaurs, ruled in the Mesozoic. Even in the Cenozoic life was fairly different from
what we see today. Humans and apes had a single ancestor. The evolution of humans is better understood as more
fossils are discovered.

Introduction

www.ck12.org

What is the source of most energy?
Almost all energy on Earth comes from the Sun. Plants make food energy from sunlight. Fossil fuels are made of
the remains of plants that stored the Sun’s energy millions of years ago. The Sun heats some areas more than others.
This causes wind. The Sun’s energy also drives the water cycle. In the water cycle, water moves over the Earth’s
surface. Both wind power and water power can be used. Earth’s internal heat does not depend on the Sun for energy.
This heat comes from remnant heat when the planet formed. It also comes from the decay of radioactive elements.
Radioactivity is an important source of energy. Energy is just one category of natural resources. Materials, like
metals and rock, are also natural resources. Plate tectonic processes are powered by Earth’s internal heat. These
processes help to create some resources. Weathering processes are driven by solar power. These processes help to
create other resources.

Chapter 12. Natural Resources

12.1 Introduction to Energy Resources

• Deﬁne energy, fuel and heat.
• Understand how energy changes form.

How can a trip to an amusement park be a learning experience?
Amusement parks use the laws of physics to generate fun! Gravity, energy, centrifugal forces are all harnessed on
various rides. Which is your favorite?

Energy

Energy is the ability to move. Energy can also change matter from one state to another (for example, from solid to
liquid). Every living thing needs energy to live and grow.
What makes energy available whenever you need it? If you unplug a lamp, the light goes off. The lamp does not
have a supply of energy to keep itself lit. The lamp uses electricity that comes through the outlet as its source of
energy. The electricity comes from a power plant. The power plant has a source of energy to produce this electricity.

901

12.1. Introduction to Energy Resources

www.ck12.org

Fuel

The energy to make the electricity comes from fuel. Fuel stores the energy and releases it when it is needed. Fuel is
any material that can release energy in a chemical change. The food you eat acts as a fuel for your body. Gasoline
and diesel fuel are fuels that provide the energy for most cars, trucks, and buses. But there are many different kinds
of fuel.
For fuel to be useful, its energy must be released in a way that can be controlled.

Heat

When fuel is burned, most of the energy is released as heat. Some of this heat can be used to do work. Heat cooks
food or warms your house. Sometimes the heat is just waste heat. It still heats the environment, though.
Heat from a wood ﬁre can boil a pot of water. If you put an egg in the pot, you can eat a hard boiled egg in 15
minutes (cool it down ﬁrst!). The energy to cook the egg was stored in the wood. The wood got that energy from the
Sun when it was part of a tree. The Sun generated the energy by nuclear fusion. You started the ﬁre with a match.
The head of the match stores energy as chemical energy. That energy lights the wood on ﬁre. The ﬁre burns as long
as there is energy in the wood. Once the wood has burned up, there is no energy left in it. The ﬁre goes out.

Using Energy

Your body gets its energy from food, but that is only a small part of the energy you use every day. Cooking your food
takes energy, and so does keeping it cold in the refrigerator or the freezer. The same is true for heating or cooling
your home. Whether you are turning on a light in the kitchen or riding in a car to school, you are using energy.
Billions of people all around the world use energy, so there is a huge demand for resources to provide all of this
energy. Why do we need so much energy? The main reason is that almost everything that happens on Earth involves
energy.

The Sources of Earth’s Energy

Almost all energy comes from the Sun. Plants make food energy from sunlight. Fossil fuels are made of the remains
of plants and animals that stored the Sun’s energy millions of years ago.
The Sun heats some areas more than others, which causes wind. The Sun’s energy also drives the water cycle, which
moves water over the surface of Earth. Both wind and water power can be used as renewable resources.
Earth’s internal heat does not depend on the Sun for energy. This heat comes from remnant heat when the planet
formed. It also comes from the decay of radioactive elements. Radioactivity is an important source of energy.

12.2 Energy Conservation

• Describe forms of energy conservation.
• Explain why energy conservation is important

What can an amusement park ride tell us about energy?
This platform is about to change energy from potential to kinetic. The energy is not lost; it just changes forms. The
is on top of a precipice. The rest of the ride runs on the potential energy the platform has when it is at the top.

Conservation of Energy

In this section, we’re not talking about saving energy. This section is about how energy cannot be created or
destroyed. Energy can only change forms. So we say that energy is conserved. Energy changes form when
something happens. But the total amount of energy always stays the same. The Law of Conservation of Energy
says that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Scientists observed that energy could change from one form to
another. They also observed that the overall amount of energy did not change.

Energy Changes

Here is an example of how energy changes form: kicking a soccer ball. Your body gets energy from food. Where
does the food get its energy? If you’re eating a plant, then the energy comes directly from the Sun. If you’re eating
an animal, then the energy comes from a plant that got its energy from the Sun.
Your body breaks down the food. It converts the food to chemical energy and stores it. When you are about to kick
the ball, the energy must be changed again. Potential energy has the potential to do work. When your leg is poised

904

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Natural Resources

to kick the ball but is not yet moving, your leg has potential energy. A ball at the top of a hill has the potential energy
of location.
Kinetic energy is the energy of anything in motion. Your muscles move your leg, your foot kicks the ball, and the
ball gains kinetic energy ( Figure 12.2). The kinetic energy was converted from potential energy that was in your leg
before the kick. The action of kicking the ball is energy changing forms. The same is true for anything that involves
change.

12.3 Renewable vs Non-Renewable Energy Re-

sources

• Deﬁne renewable resource and non-renewable resource.
• Compare and contrast renewable and non-renewable resources.
• Identify renewable and non-renewable resources.

Is your amusement park’s energy source renewable?
Nearly all amusement parks use non-renewable energy. However, a few are now starting to use renewable energy.
The Crealy Great Adventure Park in Devon, England is going solar! Solar panels will be able to generate enough
energy to power most of the park in the summer. When there is extra energy, it will supply the grid. Imagine what
an amusement park could do if it were located in a sunny place!

Types of Energy Resources

Energy resources can be put into two categories—renewable or non-renewable. Non-renewable resources are used
faster than they can be replaced. Renewable resources can be replaced as quickly as they are used. Renewable
resources may also be so abundant that running out is impossible.
The difference between non-renewable and renewable resources is like the difference between ordinary batteries and
rechargeable ones. If a ﬂashlight with ordinary batteries goes dead, the batteries need to be replaced. But if the
ﬂashlight has rechargeable batteries, the batteries can be placed in a charger. The charger transfers energy from an
outlet into the batteries. Once recharged, the batteries can be put back into the ﬂashlight. Rechargeable batteries can
be used again and again ( Figure 12.3). In this way, the energy in the rechargeable batteries is renewable.

Types of Non-Renewable Resources

Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are the greatest energy source for modern society. Millions
of years ago, plants used energy from the Sun to form carbon compounds. These compounds were later transformed

FIGURE 12.3
Rechargeable batteries are renewable because they can be reﬁlled with
energy. Is the energy they are reﬁlled with always renewable?

into coal, oil, or natural gas. Fossil fuels take millions of years to form. For this reason, they are non-renewable. We
will use most fossil fuels up in a matter of decades. Burning fossil fuels releases large amounts of pollution. The
most important of these may be the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide.

Types of Renewable Resources

Renewable energy resources include solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal power. These resources are usually
replaced at the same rate that we use them. Scientists know that the Sun will continue to shine for billions of years.
So we can use the solar energy without it ever running out. Water ﬂows from high places to lower ones. Wind blows
from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. We can use the ﬂow of wind and water to generate power. We
can count on wind and water to continue to ﬂow! Burning wood ( Figure 12.4), is an example of biomass energy.
Changing grains into biofuels is biomass energy. Biomass is renewable because we can plant new trees or crops to
replace the ones we use. Geothermal energy uses water that was heated by hot rocks. There are always more hot
rocks available to heat more water.

FIGURE 12.4
Wood is a renewable resource, but forest
ecosystems need time to replenish.

Even renewable resources can be used unsustainably. We can cut down too many trees without replanting. We might
need grains for food rather than biofuels. Some renewable resources are too expensive to be widely used. As the
technology improves and more people use renewable energy, the prices will come down. The cost of renewable
resources will go down relative to fossil fuels as we use fossil fuels up. In the long run renewable resources will
need to make up a large amount of what we use.

Important Things to Consider About Energy Resources

Before we put effort into increasing the use of an energy source, we should consider two things. Is there a practical
way to turn the resource into useful form of energy? For example, it is not practical if we don’t get much more
energy from burning a fuel than we put into making it. For example, what if it took more energy to make solar
panels than we could get from the solar panels once they were working? Then solar energy would not be worth
pursuing until better solar panels were developed.
What happens when we turn the resource into energy? What happens when we use that resource? Mining the
resource may cause a lot of health problems or environmental damage. Using the resource may create a large
amount of pollution. In this case, that fuel may also not be the best choice for an energy resource.

12.4 Fossil Fuel Formation

• Describe the formation of fossil fuels.

Where is the energy coming from to power this bumper car?
Bumper cars usually run on electricity. Much of the electricity we use comes from fossil fuels. Coal or other fuels
are burned in a power plant. This powers a generator and creates electricity. So the car is probably running on fossil
fuels!

Formation of Fossil Fuels

Fossil fuels are made from plants and animals that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. The plants used energy
from the Sun to form energy-rich carbon compounds. As the plants and animals died, their remains settled onto the
ground and at the bottom of the sea. Layer upon layer of organic material was laid down. Eventually, the layers were
buried very deeply. They experienced intense heat and pressure. Over millions of years, the organic material turned
into fossil fuels.
Fossil fuels are compounds of carbon and hydrogen, called hydrocarbons ( Figure 12.5). An animated view of a
hydrocarbon is seen here: http://www.nature.nps.gov/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/oilgas/CH4_3.MPG .
Hydrocarbons can be solid, liquid, or gas. The solid form is coal. The liquid form is petroleum, or crude oil. The
gaseous form is natural gas.
The solar energy stored in fossil fuels is a rich source of energy. But because they take so long to form, they are
nonrenewable.

12.5 Coal Power

• Explain how coal forms and is used.

Where does coal come from?
Would you go to a coal mine? It’s not very attractive. We like the beneﬁts of electricity, but coal must be mined.
Coal mining can be done by tunneling into a mountain. But if the coal is near the surface, the whole mountaintop
may be removed. That’s what’s been done in this photo.

Coal

Coal is a solid hydrocarbon. Coal is useful as a fuel, especially for generating electricity. Coal is relatively
inexpensive and abundant. Developing nations, like China, rely heavily on coal. Around the world, coal is the
largest source of energy for electricity.

How Coal Forms

Coal forms from dead plants that settled at the bottom of swamps millions of years ago ( Figure 12.6). Water and
mud in the swamp kept oxygen away from the plant material. Sand and clay settled on top of the decaying plants.
The weight of this material squeezed out the water and some other substances. Over time, the organic material
became a carbon-rich rock. This rock is coal.
Coal has different grades. Bituminous coal forms at lower temperatures. It contains a lot of sulfur. When it is burned,
it causes a lot of pollution. Anthracite coal forms under higher temperatures. This drives off the sulfur, and the coal
burns more cleanly.

913

FIGURE 12.6
The plants in this tropical swamp could
one day become coal.

What Coal Is

Coal is a black or brownish-black rock that burns easily ( Figure 12.7). Most coal is sedimentary rock. The hardest
type of coal, anthracite, is a metamorphic rock. That is because it is exposed to higher temperature and pressure as
it forms. Coal is mostly carbon, but some other elements can be found in coal, including sulfur. The coal with the
least sulfur is the cleanest coal. Anthracite has very little sulfur and so is very desirable.

FIGURE 12.7
Coal is a solid hydrocarbon formed from
decaying plant material over millions of
years.

Using Coal

To prepare coal for use, the coal is ﬁrst crushed into powder and burned in a furnace. Like other fuels, coal releases
most of its energy as heat when it burns. The heat from the burning coal is used to boil water. This makes steam.
The steam spins turbines, which creates electricity.

12.6 Petroleum Power

• Explain how petroleum forms and is used.

What is this unusual sight?
There’s oil beneath this land. These drill rigs are pumping it to the surface. Drill rigs can be small and closely
spaced. They can be large and solitary. This is true, especially when they are in deep water offshore.

Oil

Oil is a thick, dark brown or black liquid. It is found in rock layers of Earth’s crust. Oil is currently the most
commonly used source of energy in the world.

How Oil Forms

The way oil forms is similar, in many ways, to coal. Tiny organisms like plankton and algae die and settle to the
bottom of the sea. Sediments settle over the organic material. Oxygen is kept away by the sediments. When the
material is buried deep enough, it is exposed to high heat and pressure. Over millions of years, the organic material
transforms into liquid oil.

Mining Oil

The United States produces only about one-quarter as much oil as it uses. The main oil producing regions in the
U.S. are the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Alaska, and California.
Geologists look for oil in folded layers of rock called anticlines ( Figure 12.9). Oil moves through permeable rock
and is trapped by the impermeable cap rock.

917

12.6. Petroleum Power

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 12.9
Oil (red) is found in the porous rock layer
(yellow) and trapped by the impermeable
layer (brown). The folded structure has
allowed the oil to pool so a well can be
drilled into the reservoir.

Types of Oil

Oil comes out of the ground as crude oil. Crude oil is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons. Oil is separated
into different compounds at an oil reﬁnery. This is done by heating the oil. Each hydrocarbon compound in crude
oil boils at a different temperature. We get gasoline, diesel, and heating oil, plus waxes, plastics, and fertilizers from
crude oil.
These fuels are rich sources of energy. Since they are mostly liquids they can be easily transported. These fuels
provide about 90% of the energy used for transportation around the world.

Gasoline

Gasoline is a concentrated resource. It contains a large amount of energy for its weight. This is important because
the more something weighs, the more energy is needed to move it. If gasoline could only provide a little energy, a
car would have to carry a lot of it to be able to travel very far. Or the car would need to be ﬁlled up frequently. So a
highly concentrated energy resource is a practical fuel to power cars and other forms of transportation.
Let’s consider how gasoline powers a car. As gasoline burns, it releases most of its energy as heat. It also releases
carbon dioxide gas and water vapor. The heat makes the gases expand. This forces the pistons inside the engine to
move. The engine makes enough power to move the car.

Using Oil

Using gasoline to power automobiles affects the environment. The exhaust fumes from burning gasoline cause air
pollution. These pollutants include smog and ground-level ozone. Air pollution is a big problem for cities where
large numbers of people drive every day. Burning gasoline also produces carbon dioxide. This is a greenhouse gas
and is a cause of global warming. Similar pollutants come from other forms of oil.

Summary

• Petroleum is a liquid fossil fuel. Petroleum is useful for vehicles because it is easily stored and transported.
• Petroleum is also used to make waxes, plastics, fertilizers, and other products.
• Using petroleum causes smog and global warming.

12.7 Natural Gas Power

• Explain how natural gas forms and is used.
• Describe the consequences of natural gas extraction.

Why would oil drillers burn off fuel?
Natural gas is often found with petroleum. It is sometimes burned off by companies that are only interested in the
petroleum. Burning natural gas off like this is wasting energy. These days, natural gas is becoming more popular as
a fuel.

Natural Gas

Natural gas is mostly methane. Natural gas is usually found with petroleum. People prefer to burn natural gas when
possible because it is relatively clean.

920

www.ck12.org

How Natural Gas Forms

Chapter 12. Natural Resources

Natural gas is often found along with coal or oil in underground deposits. This is because natural gas forms with
these other fossil fuels. One difference between natural gas and oil is that natural gas forms at higher temperatures.

Natural Gas Use

The largest natural gas reserves in the United States are located in the Rocky Mountain states, Texas, and the Gulf of
Mexico region. California also has natural gas, mostly in the northern Sacramento Valley and the Sacramento Delta.
Natural gas must be processed before it can be used as a fuel. Poisonous chemicals and water must be removed.
Natural gas is delivered to homes, where it is used for cooking and heating. Natural gas is also a major energy source
for powering turbines to make electricity. Natural gas releases most of its energy as heat when it burns. The power
plant is able to use this heat, either in the form of hot gases or steam, to spin turbines. The spinning turbines turn
generators, and the generators create electricity.

Extracting Natural Gas

Most natural gas comes from the wells that produce petroleum. An increasing amount comes from a new method.
Hydraulic fracturing, called fracking, is very much in the news lately. Fracking makes it easier and quicker to get
natural gas from the rock ( Figure 12.10).

FIGURE 12.10
Fracking delivers natural gas from rock
that might not otherwise be obtainable.

With fracking, ﬂuids are pumped through a borehole. The ﬂuids create fractures in the rock that contains the natural
gas. Chemicals in the ﬂuid prevent the fractures from closing. The natural gas can then be pumped to the surface.

921

12.7. Natural Gas Power

www.ck12.org

Consequences of Natural Gas Extraction and Use

Natural gas burns cleaner than other fossil fuels. As a result, it causes less air pollution. It also produces less carbon
dioxide than the other fossil fuels. Because it burns cleaner than other fossil fuels, natural gas has a good reputation.
Still, natural gas does emit pollutants.
Fracking is being found to be destructive in several ways. Some of the chemicals in the fracking ﬂuids may be
harmful. Some may cause cancer. Some may be endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors interrupt the natural
hormones in the bodies of humans and animals. These ﬂuids can get into the groundwater. They may runoff into
streams and other surface waters. There they can cause problems.
The liquid waste injected into the deep wells may cause earthquakes. Locations where seismic activity is unknown
have begun to experience earthquakes. Is fracking related to earthquake activity? Many geologists think the link is
undeniable.

Summary

• Natural gas forms with crude oil but at higher temperatures.
• Natural gas burns more cleanly than petroleum and produces fewer greenhouse gases.
• Hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, is a relatively new method for extracting natural gas. Fracking may

be linked to groundwater contamination and small earthquakes in non-seismic regions.

12.8 Fossil Fuel Reserves

• Describe the alternative fossil fuels.
• Know their environmental impacts.

Take a trip to Washington, D.C.?
People are always protesting in our nation’s capital. That’s part of liberty, part of democracy. The people in this
photo are protesting against the Keystone XL pipeline. Other people in other locations may be protesting for the
pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline would bring crude oil from tar sands to the United States. People in favor say
the oil from tar sands will bring down energy costs and provide jobs. People opposed say that the environmental
consequences are not worth the beneﬁts.

Alternative Fossil Fuels

Easy-to-reach fossil fuel sources are being used up. Technologies are being developed to get at harder-to-reach
sources. Also, ways to tap into alternative sources of fossil fuels are increasingly being developed. These sources
include oil shale and tar sands.

Oil Shale

Oil shale is rock with oil dispersed through it. The oil has not collected in reservoirs. Oil shale is mined in open
pit mines. To extract the oil from the rock, the rock is ﬁrst crushed and heated to very high temperatures. Water is
washed over the rock, which converts the fuel to petroleum. The petroleum can then be extracted from the rock. You
can see an example of an oil shale facility below ( Figure 12.11).
Most of the world’s oil shale is spread out in large areas of Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. In this region, water is
scarce. Since the oil shale is spread over a large area, mining would be environmentally destructive.

923

FIGURE 12.11
An image of an oil shale facility in Col-
orado.

Tar Sands

Tar sands are rocky materials mixed with very thick oil. The tar is too thick to pump, and so tar sands are strip-
mined. Hot water and caustic soda are used to separate the oil from the rock. This creates a slurry, which is shaken.
The oil ﬂoats to the top and is skimmed off.
About 75% of the tar sands in the world are in Venezuela and Alberta, Canada ( Figure 12.12). Large areas of land
are degraded when tar sands are mined. A tremendous amount of waste rock is produced from mining tar sands.

FIGURE 12.12
A satellite image of an oil-sands mine in
Canada.

Consequences of Using Alternative Fossil Fuels

Surface mining causes environmental damage. A lot of water may be needed. The water may be degraded. For oil
to be removed from shale, the water must be heated. This requires energy. Tar sands and oil shale fuels create more
pollutants than other fossil fuels. Extracting usable energy from oil shale and tar sands produces more greenhouse
gases.

924

www.ck12.org

Keystone XL Pipeline

Chapter 12. Natural Resources

The Keystone XL Pipeline would transport oil from the oil sands in Alberta, Canada. The oil would travel into
the United States. In the U.S. it would be reﬁned. The pipeline is controversial. A leak could cause damage to
wildlife habitat. A leak could also release enough oil to contaminate the Ogallala Aquifer. The Aquifer is crucial to
agriculture and urban development in the Midwestern U.S. When burned, the fuel from the oil sands would increase
pollutants. Greenhouse gases into the atmosphere would increase. The future of the pipeline is currently on hold.

Summary

• Easy to get at fossil fuels are running out, but there are other sources that are harder to get at that are still

available.

• Oil shales and tar sands are two of the alternative sources of fossil fuels that are much in the news.
• The need for fossil fuels continues to grow as people in the developed world use more, and more people in the

developing world want them.

• Explain how nuclear energy is harnessed and used.
• Describe the consequences of using nuclear energy.

Where could long-term nuclear waste go?
That’s a very good question. For years, a waste facility was in development in Nevada. The site at Yucca Mountain
was canceled due to public outcry. Now there is no facility for storing long-term nuclear waste from most sources.
No facilities are currently being developed either.

Nuclear Energy

Nuclear energy is produced by splitting the nucleus of an atom. This releases a huge amount of energy.

How Nuclear Power Plants Work

Nuclear power plants use uranium that has been concentrated in fuel rods ( Figure 12.13). The uranium atoms are
split apart when they are hit by other extremely tiny particles. These particles must be controlled or they would
cause a dangerous explosion.
Nuclear power plants use the energy they produce to heat water. The water turns into steam, which causes a turbine
to spin. This, in turn, produces electricity.

Nuclear Power as a Resource

Many countries around the world use nuclear energy as a source of electricity. For example, France gets about 80%
of its electricity from nuclear energy. In the United States, a little less than 20% of electricity comes from nuclear
energy.
Nuclear energy does not pollute. If there are no accidents, a nuclear power plant releases nothing but steam into
the air. But nuclear energy does create other environmental problems. Splitting atoms creates dangerous radioactive
waste. These wastes can remain dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years. Scientists and engineers are still
looking for ways to keep this waste safely away from people.

KQED: Nuclear Energy Use

Nuclear power is a controversial subject in California and most other places. Nuclear power has no pollutants
including no carbon emissions. However, power plants are not always safe. The long-term disposal of wastes is a
problem that has not yet been solved. The future of nuclear power is murky. Find out more at: http://science.kqed.

Consequences of Nuclear Power

Nuclear power is clean. It does not pollute the air. However, the use of nuclear energy does create other environ-
mental problems. Uranium must be mined ( Figure 12.14). The process of splitting atoms creates radioactive waste.
This waste may be dangerous for thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. As yet, there is no long-term solution
for storing the radioactive waste.
For three decades new nuclear power plants were not built in the U.S. Accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl,
Ukraine made people nervous about harnessing nuclear power ( Figure 12.15).
Because nuclear energy is clean, nuclear power was making a comeback. But the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan changed attitudes back. This accident seems to have resulted in a new fear
of nuclear power. The disaster was caused by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami. These events seriously
damaged the plant.

12.10 Solar Power

• Explain how solar energy is collected and used.

Why don’t we get our energy straight from the source?
The Sun produces far more energy than humans can use. The Sun is also the source of most of the energy we use.
Fossil fuels and wind energy, for example, originate with the Sun. So why don’t we get all our energy from the Sun?
For one reason, it’s not always practical.

the sunlight for use.

Energy from the Sun

Chapter 12. Natural Resources

The Sun is Earth’s main source of energy. The Sun gives us both light and heat. The Sun changes hydrogen into
helium through nuclear fusion. This releases huge amounts of energy. The energy travels to Earth mostly as visible
light. The energy is carried through the empty space by radiation. We can use sunlight as an energy resource, called
solar energy.

Solar Energy as a Resource

Solar energy has been used on a small scale for hundreds of years. Today we are using solar energy for more of our
power demands. Solar power plants are being built in many locations around the world. In the United States, the
southwestern deserts are well suited for solar plants.

Solar Power Plants

Sunlight is turned into electricity at a solar power plant. A large group of mirrors focuses sunlight on one place.
This place is called a receiver ( Figure 12.17). At the receiver, a liquid such as oil or water is heated to a high
temperature. The liquid transfers its heat by conduction. In conduction, energy moves between two objects that are
in contact. The warmer object transfers heat to the cooler object. At a solar power plant, the energy conducted by
the heated liquid is used to make electricity.

FIGURE 12.17
A solar power tower is used to concentrate the solar energy collected by
many solar panels.

Solar Energy Use

Solar energy is used to heat homes and water, and to make electricity. Scientists and engineers have many ways
to get energy from the Sun ( Figure 12.16). One is by using solar cells. Solar cells are devices that turn sunlight
directly into electricity. Lots of solar cells make up an individual solar panel. You may have seen solar panels on
roof tops. The Sun’s heat can also be trapped in your home by using south facing windows and good insulation.

Consequences of Solar Energy Use

Solar energy has many beneﬁts. It does not produce any pollution, and there is plenty of it available—much more
than we could possibly use.
But solar energy has problems. The Sun doesn’t shine at night. A special battery is needed to store extra energy
during the day for use at night. The technology for most uses of solar energy is still expensive. Until solar technology
becomes more affordable, most people will prefer to get their energy from other sources.

12.11 Hydroelectric Power

• Explain how falling water is harnessed for hydroelectric power.
• Describe the consequences of hydroelectric power use.

What do dams do?
If you take a trip out of Las Vegas toward Phoenix you can visit the Hoover Dam. Completed in 1935, the dam
provides power to over a million homes. It also stores water for use by the residents of the desert southwest. Hoover
Dam is one of the engineering marvels of the 20th century.

Water Power

Moving water has energy ( Figure 12.18). That energy is used to make electricity. Hydroelectric power, or
hydropower, harnesses the energy of water moving down a stream. Hydropower is the most widely used form of
renewable energy in the world. This abundant energy source provides almost one ﬁfth of the world’s electricity. The
energy of waves and tides can also be used to produce water power. At this time, wave and tidal power are rare.

Hydropower Plants

To harness water power, a stream must be dammed. Narrow valleys are the best for dams. While sitting in the
reservoir behind the dam, the water has potential energy. Water is allowed to ﬂow downhill into a large turbine. While
ﬂowing downhill, the water has kinetic energy. Kinetic energy makes the turbine spin. The turbine is connected to a
generator, which makes electricity.

933

12.11. Hydroelectric Power

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 12.18
Water ﬂowing through a dam.

Hydropower as a Resource

Many of the suitable streams in the United States have been developed for hydroelectric power. Many streams
worldwide also have hydroelectric plants. Hydropower is a major source of California’s electricity. It accounts for
about 14.5 percent of the total. Most of California’s nearly 400 hydroelectric power plants are located in the Sierra
Nevada mountains.

Beneﬁts and Problems of Hydropower

Water power does not burn a fuel. So it causes less pollution than many other kinds of energy. Water power is also
a renewable resource. Water keeps ﬂowing downhill. Although we use some of the energy from this movement, we
are not using up the water.
Water power does have problems. A large dam stops a stream’s ﬂow, which ﬂoods the land upstream ( Figure 12.19).
A beautiful location may be lost. People may be displaced. The dams and turbines also change the downstream
environment. Fish and other living things may not be able to survive. Dams slow the release of silt. Downstream
deltas retreat and beaches may be starved of sand. Seaside cities may become exposed to storms and rising sea
levels.
Tidal power stations may need to close off a narrow bay or estuary. Wave power plants must withstand coastal storms
and the corrosion of seawater.

KQED: Harnessing Power from the Sea

Although not yet widely used, many believe tidal power has more potential than wind or solar power for meeting
alternative energy needs. Quest radio looks at plans for harnessing power from the sea by San Francisco and along

12.12 Wind Power

• Explain how wind energy is harnessed and used.
• Describe the consequences of using wind energy.

Is this what a wind farm looks like?
It’s a strange sight. You’re driving up the road in Southern California, and sprouting from the ground is a pack of
windmills! Windmills are becoming more common on the eastern side of the mountains. This is because the wind
comes off the Paciﬁc Ocean and funnels through mountain passes. The wind is strong and California wants to take
advantage of it.

Wind Power

The energy from the Sun creates wind ( Figure 12.20). Wind energy moves by convection. The Sun heats some
locations more than others. Warm air rises, so other air rushes in to ﬁll the hole left by the rising air. This horizontal
movement of air is called wind.

937

12.12. Wind Power

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 12.20
Winds are funneled through passes in mountain ranges. Altamont Pass in
California is the site of many wind turbines.

Wind as a Resource

Wind power uses moving air as a source of energy. Some types of wind power have been around for a long time.
People have used windmills to grind grain and pump water for hundreds of years. Sailing ships have depended on
wind for millennia. Wind is now used to generate electricity. Moving air can make a turbine spin, just like moving
water can. Moving air has kinetic energy. When wind hits the blades of the turbine, the kinetic energy makes the
blades move. The turbine spins and creates electricity.

Wind Power Advantages and Disadvantages

Wind power has many advantages. It is clean: it does not release pollutants or carbon dioxide. It is plentiful almost
everywhere. The technology to harness wind energy is being developed rapidly.
Wind power also has problems. Wind does not blow all of the time, so wind energy must be stored for later
use. Alternatively, another energy source needs to be available when the wind is not blowing. Wind turbines are
expensive. They can wear out quickly. Finally, windmills are not welcomed by residents of some locations. They
say that they are unattractive. Yet even with these problems, wind turbines are a competitive form of renewable
energy.
Many states are currently using wind power. Wind turbines are set up in mountain passes. This is common in
California, where cool Paciﬁc Ocean air is sucked across the passes and into the warmer inland valleys.

Summary

• Wind contains kinetic energy. The energy can move a turbine. This generates electricity.
• Wind power is clean. It does not release pollutants or greenhouse gases.
• Some people complain about the spread of windmills across certain locations, but, still, the use of wind energy

is increasing.

12.13 Geothermal Power

• Explain how geothermal energy is harnessed and used.

Why is there so much heat coming from below?
A visit to an active geothermal area is likely to be very interesting. Some of the most active ones in the U.S. are
Yellowstone in Wyoming and Lassen Peak in California. These places are not available for energy production. But
the Geysers Geothermal Resource Area in California is used for energy. A magma chamber deep below produces
dry superheated steam. This steam can be harnessed.

Geothermal Energy

Geothermal energy stems from Earth’s internal heat. Hot springs and geysers are produced by water that is heated
by magma or hot rock below the surface.
At a geothermal power plant, engineers drill wells into the hot rocks. Hot water or steam may come up through the
wells. Alternatively, water may be put down into the well to be heated. It then comes up. The hot water or steam
makes a turbine spin. This makes electricity. Pictured below is an example of a geothermal power plant ( Figure
12.21).

Geothermal Energy as a Resource

Because the hot water or steam can be used directly to make a turbine spin, geothermal energy can be used without
processing. Geothermal energy is clean and safe. It is renewable. There will always be hot rocks, and water can be
pumped down into a well. There, the water can be heated again to make more steam.
Geothermal energy is an excellent resource in some parts of the world.
Iceland gets about one fourth of its
electricity from geothermal sources. In the United States, California leads all states in producing geothermal energy.
Geothermal energy in California is concentrated in the northern part of the state. The largest plant is in the Geysers
Geothermal Resource Area. Geothermal energy is not economical everywhere. Many parts of the world do not have
underground sources of heat that are close enough to the surface for building geothermal power plants.

12.14 Energy from Biomass

• Explain how biomass energy is harnessed and used.
• Describe why algae is a good source of biofuel.

Does this look like energy to you?
Algae is sometimes mocked as a source of fuel. But algae are a potentially wonderful source of power. They convert
energy from the Sun into food by photosynthesis. Algae can be grown in desert areas where other crops cannot grow.
Nutrients for algae may be wastes from other processes. Algae can be processed to be made into a liquid. There is a
lot of research going on to harness algae for biofuels.

Biomass

Biomass is the material that comes from plants and animals that were recently living. Biomass can be burned directly.
This happens when you burn a log in your ﬁreplace. For as long as humans have had ﬁre, people have used biomass
for heating and cooking.
To generate biomass energy, break down the cell walls of plants. This releases the sugars. The sugars are then
fermented to create fuel.

Biofuel

More recently, people have learned to process biomass to make fuel. This is called biofuel. Biofuel is created from
crops, such as corn or algae. Biofuel is unique among renewable energy sources. This is because it is liquid. Unlike
solar energy, for example, biofuels can be used in a car ( Figure 12.22). Biofuels burn more cleanly than fossil fuels.
They create less pollution and less carbon dioxide. Biofuels, such as ethanol, are added to gasoline. This cuts down
the amount of fossil fuels that are used.

Sources of Biomass Energy

Any organic material can be made into electricity. But some materials are better than others. Wastes can be used,
like almond shells. Biomass power is a great use of wastes. It’s hard to use wastes as a consistent large scale source
of energy though.

Consequences of Biomass Use

Some crops do not make good biofuels. Crops need energy, fertilizer, and land to grow. Sometimes the amount of
resources that go into producing the crop is too high. The crop produces very little energy more than it consumes.
Corn is a very inefﬁcient source of biofuels. Also, the fertilizers and pesticides used to grow the crops enter the
environment. They run off the crops and become damaging pollutants in nearby water bodies or in the oceans.
Scientists are looking for much better sources of biomass energy.

Algae Biofuels

Research is being done into alternative crops for biofuels. A very promising alternative is algae. Algae appears to be
a better biofuel than corn. Algae is much easier to convert to a usable fuel. Growing algae requires much less land
and energy than crops. Algae can be grown in locations that are not used for other things. For example, they can be

944

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Natural Resources

grown in desert areas where food crops are not often grown. Corn must be grown where food crops are grown. This
can reduce the land and water available for growing food. Algae can be fed agricultural and other waste, so valuable
resources are not used. Much research is being done to bring these alternative fuels to market.

12.16 Renewable Versus Non-Renewable Re-

sources

• Deﬁne renewable and non-renewable resources.
• Know how a renewable resource can become a non-renewable resource.

What is the difference between these two stands of trees?
Trees are renewable resources. Trees can be planted, grown up, and harvested for timber. Forests are a different
thing, however. A forest is a mature ecosystem. It has trees of different sizes and ages, many other plants, and lots of
animals. A forest is a renewable resource but it takes much more time to grow a forest than to grow a stand of trees.

Renewable Resources

Renewable resources can be renewed as they are used. An example is timber, which comes from trees. New trees
can be planted to replace those that are cut down. Sunlight is a renewable resource. It seems we will never run out
of that! What are some other renewable resources?
Just because a resource is renewable, it doesn’t mean we should use it carelessly. If we aren’t careful, we can pollute
resources. Then they may no longer be ﬁt for use. Water is one example. If we pollute a water source, it may not be
usable for drinking, bathing, or any other type of use. We can also overuse resources that should be renewable. In
this case, the resources may not be able to recover. For example, ﬁsh are renewable resources. That’s because they
can reproduce and make more ﬁsh. But water pollution and overﬁshing can cause them to die out if their population
becomes too low. Another example is pictured below ( Figure 12.23).

Non-Renewable Resources

Some resources can’t be renewed. At least, they can’t be renewed fast enough to keep up with use. Fossil fuels are
an example. It takes millions of years for them to form. We are using them up much more quickly. Elements that
are used to produce nuclear power are also non-renewable resources. Uranium, for example, which is rare. Sooner
or later, it will run out.
Supplies of non-renewable resources are shrinking. This makes them harder to get. Oil is a good example. Oil
reserves beneath land are running out. So oil companies have started to drill for oil far out in the ocean. This costs
more money. It’s also more dangerous. Pictured below is an oil rig that exploded in 2010 ( Figure 12.24). The
explosion killed 11 people. Millions of barrels of oil spilled into the water. It took months to plug the leak.

Summary

• Resources may be renewable or non-renewable.
• Renewable resources should never run out. Non-renewable resources are available in limited supply.
• Some non-renewable resources are in shorter supply than before. It takes more effort to get to them.

12.17. Ore Deposits

www.ck12.org

12.17 Ore Deposits

• Deﬁne ore deposit.
• Determine what makes an ore deposit proﬁtable or unproﬁtable.

How would you ﬁnd ores?
There are many steps to ﬁnding an ore deposit. Find a place with likely geology. Test the soil and rock for the ore
mineral or others that are often found with the ore mineral. Drill to test deeper rock and soil. Then make a map and
do the calculations. If the deposit is found to be proﬁtable, you can begin mining.

Using Minerals

When you use a roll of aluminum foil or some baby powder, you probably don’t think about how the products were
made. You may not even know that those products are from minerals! We use minerals in many everyday items.
Minerals have to be located, removed from the ground, and reﬁned before they can be made into the products.

Ore Deposits

A rock that contains important minerals is called an ore. The concentration of valuable minerals in an ore may be
high or low.
Certain places on Earth are more likely to have certain ores. Geologists search for the places that might have ore
deposits. For example, if you want copper, you need to look at regions with a particular geology. Copper is often
found where hot ﬂuids came off of a magma intrusion. Aluminum is found in intensely weathered soils in tropical
areas. Some of the valuable deposits may be hidden underground. Some may be at the surface.
To ﬁnd a mineral deposit, geologists study the geology of a lot of places. They then go to a spot where that type of
mineral deposit could be found. They test the properties of the soil and rocks. They look at the chemistry and the
physical properties. They determine if a mineral deposit is nearby.

952

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Natural Resources

After a mineral deposit is found, geologists determine how big it is. They may drill holes. They will test the
chemistry of the rock from the holes. Using this information, they will outline the deposit on a map. This will allow
them to determine the size and the concentration of ore minerals. The geologists then calculate the total amount of
valuable minerals they think are in the deposit. The ore will only be mined if it is proﬁtable. Only if it is proﬁtable,
is a mineral deposit called an ore deposit.
The bauxite pictured below ( Figure 12.25) is a rock that contains minerals that are used to make aluminum.

FIGURE 12.25
Aluminum is made from the minerals in rocks known as bauxite.

If a mineral deposit is not proﬁtable to mine it is not an ore deposit. If conditions change, a deposit may become
proﬁtable that wasn’t before. Or an ore deposit may no longer be proﬁtable to mine. What could occur to make these
changes? The price of the ore could rise or fall. The price of extracting the ore could change. For example, if the
ore is hard to get at and the price of fuel goes up. This may make the mineral deposit unproﬁtable to mine.

Summary

• An ore is a rock that contains important minerals.
• An ore deposit must be proﬁtable to mine. If it is no longer proﬁtable, it is no longer an ore deposit.
• Geologists ﬁnd ore deposits by testing the chemistry of the rock and soil. They can also determine the size of

the deposit.

12.18 Mining Ores

• Describe how ore deposits are mined.

Can you be a miner too?
Yes! You can go to certain rivers or streams to mine for gold placers. You dip a large metal pan into the stream, and
get some gravel and a little water. You swish the mix around. The gold is the heaviest material and it will sink to the
bottom of the pan. You can then extract it. The placers in the U.S with a lot of ore have already been mined out. But
you might make a little money!

Mining Ores

If an ore is found to be proﬁtable, it will probably be mined. There are two major types of mining: surface mining
and underground mining. There are different types of each of those two.

Surface Mining

Surface mining allows extraction of ores that are close to Earth’s surface. Overlying rock is blasted, and the rock
that contains the valuable minerals is placed in a truck. The truck takes the rock to a reﬁnery. As pictured below (
Figure 12.26), surface mining includes open-pit mining and mountaintop removal. As the name suggests, open-pit
mining creates a big pit from which the ore is mined. The size of the pit grows as long as the miners can make a
proﬁt.
Other methods of surface mining include strip mining, placer mining, and dredging. Strip mining is like open pit
mining but with material removed along a strip. A quarry is a type of open-pit mine that produces rocks and minerals
that are used to make buildings and roads.

Chapter 12. Natural Resources

FIGURE 12.26
Open pit mining is a form of surface
mining, extracting ores close to Earth’s
surface.

Placers are valuable minerals found in stream gravels. California’s nickname, the Golden State, can be traced back
to the discovery of placer deposits of gold in 1848. The gold weathered out of hard metamorphic rock in the western
Sierra Nevada. The rock also contained deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, chromite, and other valuable minerals.
The gold traveled down rivers and then settled in gravel deposits. Currently, California has active mines for gold and
silver. Non-metal minerals such as sand and gravel, which are used for construction, are also mined in California
and elsewhere.

Underground Mining

Underground mining is used to recover ores that are deeper into Earth’s surface. Miners blast and tunnel into rock
to gain access to the ores. An underground ore deposit can be approached from above, below, or sideways. The
direction depends on the placement of the ore body, its depth, the concentration of ore, and the strength of the
surrounding rock. An example of an underground mine can be seen below ( Figure 12.27).
Underground mining is very expensive and dangerous. Fresh air and lights must also be brought into the tunnels for
the miners. Accidents are far too common.

• Surface mines are created for mineral deposits that are near the surface.
• Underground mines are blasted into rock to get at deeper deposits.
• Underground mining is difﬁcult; the safety and health of the miners is hard to maintain.

12.19 Extracting Ores

• Describe how ore deposits are reﬁned to become useful materials.

How can you save energy and materials?
Getting ore from rock takes a lot of energy. Getting ore from preexisting materials uses a lot less. It turns out that if
you recycle just 40 aluminum cans, you will save the energy in one gallon of gasoline. You will save aluminum too!

Ore Extraction

When the ore leaves the mine, it is not yet a useful material ( Figure 12.28). Most ores are a combination of metal
and other elements. The rocks are full of valuable minerals. They also contain rock that isn’t valuable, which is
called waste rock. The valuable minerals must be separated from the waste rock.

FIGURE 12.28
Enormous trucks haul rock containing ore from a mine site to where the
rock is processed.

To separate the ore from the waste rock, ﬁrst the rocks are crushed. Then the minerals are separated out of the ore.
There are a few methods for doing this:

957

12.19. Extracting Ores

www.ck12.org

• Heap Leaching: the addition of chemicals, such as cyanide or acid, to remove ore. This is often done at very

high temperatures.

• Flotation: the addition of a compound that attaches to the valuable mineral and ﬂoats.
• Smelting: roasting rock at a temperature greater than 900oC. This causes it to segregate into layers. The

valuable minerals are then extracted. This requires a lot of energy.

Extracting metal from rock is so energy-intensive that it’s much better to recycle. We use over 80 billion aluminum
cans each year. If all of these cans were recycled, we would save the energy in 2 billion gallons of gasoline!

Summary

• To extract ore from rock, the rock is ﬁrst crushed.
• Ore is extracted from rock by heap leaching, ﬂotation, or smelting.
• Extracting ore from rock can take a lot of energy.

12.20 Environmental Impacts of Mining

• Describe the environmental costs of mining.

Can you tell that this was a mine?
Mining can do a lot of damage to a region. Mining companies are now supposed to return the land to its natural state
when they are done. Sometimes this works really well. It’s hard to tell there was a mine here!

Mining and the Environment

Mining provides people with many resources they need. But mining can be hazardous to the environment. For
surface mines, miners clear the land of soil and plants. Nearby lakes and streams may be inundated with sediment.
The mined rock may include heavy metals. These also enter the sediment and water. Removing metals from rock
may involve toxic chemicals. Acid ﬂow from a mine site will change the chemistry of a nearby stream or lake.

Land Reclamation

U.S. law states that once mining is complete, the land must be restored to its natural state. This process is called
reclamation. A pit may be reﬁlled with dirt. It may be ﬁlled with water to create a lake. The pits may be turned into
landﬁlls. Underground mines may be sealed off or left open as homes for bats. The land is reshaped. Native plants
are planted.

Mine Pollution

Mining can cause pollution. Chemicals released from mining can contaminate nearby water sources. Pictured
below is water that is contaminated from a nearby mine ( Figure 12.29). The United States government has mining
standards to protect water quality.

Summary

• Surface mining clears the land. Rock, dirt, and plants are all disturbed.
• Mining releases pollutants from rock or as metals are removed from rock.
• Reclamation occurs when people attempt to return the mined land to its original state.

12.21 Hazardous Waste

• Deﬁne hazardous waste.
• Describe the types of hazardous waste.

When do a few illnesses indicate a larger problem?
At Love Canal, New York, many children became sick. Many pregnancies never went to term. More than half of the
babies born had a birth defect. Residents started to notice that things were not normal. When they investigated, they
found out that their homes and school were built on a toxic waste dump. They called attention to the problem and
asked for help.

The Story of Love Canal

Love Canal is a neighborhood in Niagara Falls. It is the site of one of the worst environmental disasters of all time.
Love Canal gained worldwide attention in the late 1970s when the press started covering its story. The story is
outlined and illustrated below ( Figure 12.30).

Pollution by Hazardous Waste

Love Canal highlighted the problem of pollution by hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is any waste that is
dangerous to the health of people or the environment. It may be dangerous because it is toxic, corrosive, ﬂammable,
or explosive. Hazardous waste can contaminate the land, soil and water.

961

12.21. Hazardous Waste

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 12.30
What can we learn from the story of Love Canal?

• Toxic waste is poisonous. Toxic waste may cause cancer or birth defects in people. It may also harm other

living things.

• Corrosive waste is highly reactive with other substances. Corrosive waste may cause burns or destroy other

materials that it touches.

• Flammable waste can burn easily. It may also give off harmful fumes when it burns.
• Explosive waste is likely to explode. The risk of explosion may be greater if the waste is mixed with other

substances.

of properly.

Electronics, such as old computers, contain toxic chem-
icals. They may be sent to landﬁlls where the toxic
materials end up in the ground.

Medical waste can contain many hazards: Human
body ﬂuids may cause disease; old thermometers may
contain toxic mercury; and pharmaceuticals may be
toxic to people and other living things.

Paints can be both toxic and ﬂammable. Paints may
spill on the ground or be thrown improperly in the trash.

Chemicals are applied to farm ﬁelds and lawns. They
include fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Many of
these chemicals are toxic to people and other animals.

12.22 Preventing Hazardous Waste Problems

• Explain how to prevent pollution by hazardous wastes.

What should be done about hazardous waste sites?
Laws now protect lands from contamination. Many sites were damaged before those laws were passed. Cleaning up
toxic wastes costs a lot of time and money. Sometimes the company that caused the damage no longer exists.
Sometimes they cannot afford cleanup. Then it becomes the government’s job to clean up the site. No other
organization is big enough to be sure a cleanup happens.

The Superfund Act

Love Canal opened people’s eyes to toxic waste burial. They realized there must be other “Love Canals” all over the
country. Thousands of contaminated sites were found. The Superfund Act was passed in 1980. The law required
that money be set aside for cleanup of toxic waste sites. The law also required safer disposal of hazardous waste in
the future.
Love Canal became a Superfund site in 1983. As a result, several measures were taken to secure the toxic wastes.
The land was capped so that water could not reach the waste. Toxic material was cleaned from the nearby area.
Contaminated soils were removed.

Controlling Hazardous Waste

The greatest source of hazardous waste is industry. Agriculture is another major source. Even households produce a
lot of hazardous waste.

Hazardous Waste from Industry and Agriculture

Thanks to the lessons of Love Canal, the U.S. now has laws requiring the safe disposal of hazardous waste.
Companies must ensure that hazardous waste is not allowed to enter the environment in dangerous amounts. They

965

12.22. Preventing Hazardous Waste Problems

www.ck12.org

must also protect their workers from hazardous materials. For example, they must provide employees with the proper
safety gear and training ( Figure 12.31).

FIGURE 12.31
This agricultural worker is wearing the proper safety gear to handle a
chemical pesticide.

Household Hazardous Waste

Cleaning products, lawn chemicals, paints, batteries, motor oil—these are just some of the many hazardous materials
that may be found in households. You might think that a household doesn’t produce enough hazardous waste to worry
about. But all the waste from all the households adds up. A city of just 50,000 people might produce more than 40
tons of hazardous waste each year! Clearly, how households deal with hazardous waste matters.
What can your family do? Reduce, reuse, recycle, or properly dispose of the wastes.

1. Reduce the amount of hazardous products you buy. For example, if you only need a quart of paint for a job,

don’t buy a gallon.

2. Use less hazardous products if you can. For example, clean windows with vinegar and water instead of toxic

window cleaners.

3. Reuse products if it’s safe to do so. For example, paint thinner that has been used to clean paint brushes can

be strained and reused.

4. Recycle whenever possible. For example, some service stations allow you to drop off used motor oil, car

batteries, or tires for recycling.

5. Always properly dispose of hazardous waste. For example, let liquid waste evaporate before placing the

container in the trash.

Proper disposal depends on the waste. Many hazardous products have disposal guidelines on the label. That’s
one reason why you should keep the products in their original containers. The labels also explain how to use the
products safely. Follow the instructions to protect yourself and the environment. Most communities have centers for
disposing of household hazardous waste ( Figure 12.32). Do you know how to dispose of hazardous waste in your
community?

FIGURE 12.32

12.23 Availability of Natural Resources

• Discuss what factors are important in resource availability.
• Learn who uses most of the world’s resources.

Who uses more resources?
It’s not hard to tell that the people on the right use more resources than those in the home on the left. Many natural
resources were needed to create a home like this. Imagine a world in which everybody had equal access to resources.
Some people would have fewer resources than they do now. But many people would have more.

Resource Availability

Whether a resource is available for use depends on several factors.

• Supply: Some resources are very abundant. Some are rare. When a resource is close to running out, a

replacement needs to be found. Some resources are very valuable because they are very rare.

• Price: The price of a resource depends on how much of it is available. It also depends on how easy it is to
ﬁnd and extract. A resource may not be used until its price goes up enough to cover the costs of ﬁnding and
extracting it.

• Politics: Resources are not found equally around the world. Some nations may have a lot of certain vital
resources. Some nations may have none. It is possible for a nation rich in a resource to control who gets it.
They can also control the price.

Who Uses Natural Resources?

Rich nations use more natural resources than poor nations. In fact, the richest 20 percent of people use 85 percent
of the world’s resources. What about the poorest 20 percent of people? They use only 1 percent of the world’s
resources ( Figure 12.33).

More People, More Resources

Every 20 minutes, the human population adds 3,500 more people. More people need more resources. For example,
we now use ﬁve times more fossil fuels than we did in 1970. The human population is expected to increase for at

Summary

• The availability of a resource depends on how much of it there is, how much it costs to get, and where it is

located.

• Politics plays an important role in resource availability.
• The world’s wealthiest people use most of the resources. The world’s poorest people use very few resources.

12.24 Natural Resource Conservation

• Learn the value of conservation.
• Describe the three R’s: reduce, reuse, recycle.

Can you make a difference?
Yes! You can conserve natural resources every day with every decision you make. Should you recycle that can?
Yes! Should you buy a bottle of water or drink from the water fountain? Fountain! Should you walk or ride your
bike to school or ask for a ride? Walk or ride your bike—it’s good exercise too!

Conserving Natural Resources

How can we protect Earth’s natural resources? One answer is conservation. This means saving resources. We need
to save resources so some will be left for the future. We also need to protect resources from pollution and overuse.
When we conserve resources, we also cut down on the trash we produce. Americans throw out 340 million tons of
trash each year. We throw out 2.5 million plastic bottles alone—every hour! Most of what we throw out ends up in
landﬁlls ( Figure 12.34). In a landﬁll, all those plastic bottles take hundreds of years to break down. What are the
problems caused by producing so much trash? Natural resources must be used to produce the materials. Land must
be given over to dump the materials. If the materials are toxic, they may cause pollution.

The Three “R”s

You probably already know about the three “R”s. They stand for reduce, reuse, and recycle. The third “R”—recycle—has
caught on in a big way. That’s because it’s easy. There are thousands of places to drop off items such as aluminum
cans for recycling. Many cities allow you to just put your recycling in a special can and put it at the curb.
We haven’t done as well with the ﬁrst two “R”s—reducing and reusing. But they aren’t always as easy as recycling.
Recycling is better than making things from brand new materials. But it still takes some resources to turn recycled
items into new ones. It takes no resources at all to reuse items or not buy them in the ﬁrst place.

FIGURE 12.34

Reduce

Reducing resource use means just what it says—using fewer resources. There are lots of ways to reduce our use of
resources.

• Buy durable goods. Choose items that are well made so they will last longer. You’ll buy fewer items in the

long run, so you’ll save money as well as resources. That’s a win-win!

• Repair rather than replace. Fix your bike rather than buying a new one. Sew on a button instead of buying a

new shirt. You’ll use fewer resources and save money.

• Buy only what you need. Don’t buy a gallon of milk if you can only drink half of it before it spoils. Instead,

buy a half gallon and drink all of it. You won’t be wasting resources (or money!).

• Buy local. For example, buy local produce at a farmer’s market, like the one pictured below ( Figure 12.35).
A lot of resources are saved by not shipping goods long distances. Products bought at farmer’s markets use
less packaging, too!

FIGURE 12.35
Buying locally grown produce at a farmer’s market saves resources.

About a third of what we throw out is packaging. Try to buy items with the least amount of packaging. For example,
buy bulk items instead of those that are individually wrapped. Also, try to select items with packaging that can be
reused or recycled. This is called precycling. Pop cans and plastic water bottles, for example, are fairly easy to
recycle. Some types of packaging are harder to recycle ( Figure 12.36). If it can’t be reused or recycled, it’s a waste
of resources.

• Many plastics: The recycling symbol on the bottom of plastic containers shows the type of plastic they contain.

Numbers 1 and 2 are easier to recycle than higher numbers.

972

www.ck12.org

Chapter 12. Natural Resources

• Mixed materials: Packaging that contains more than one material may be hard to recycle. This carton is made

mostly of cardboard. But it has plastic around the opening.

FIGURE 12.36
These types of packaging are hard to
recycle. Could you reuse any of them?

Reuse

Reusing resources means using items again instead of throwing them away. A reused item can be used in the same
way by someone else. Or it can be used in a new way. For example, Shana has a pair of jeans she has outgrown. She
might give them to her younger sister to wear. Or she might use them to make something different for herself, say, a
denim shoulder bag. Some other ideas for reusing resources are pictured below ( Figure 12.37).

FIGURE 12.37
Do you reuse products, like these? Can
you think of other ways to reuse re-
sources?

Recycle

Many things can be recycled. The materials in them can be reused in new products. For example, plastic water
bottles can be recycled. The recycled material can be made into t-shirts! Old phone books can also be recycled and

973

12.24. Natural Resource Conservation

www.ck12.org

made into textbooks. When you shop for new products, look for those that are made of recycled materials ( Figure
12.38). Even food scraps and lawn waste can be recycled. They can be composted and turned into humus for the
garden.

FIGURE 12.38
This label shows that the product was made from recycled materials.

At most recycling centers, you can drop off metal cans, cardboard and paper products, glass containers, and plastic
bottles. Recycling stations, like the one pictured below ( Figure 12.39), are common. Curbside recycling usually
takes these items too. Do you know how to recycle in your community? Contact your local solid waste authority to
ﬁnd out. If you don’t already recycle, start today. It’s a big way you can help the planet!

FIGURE 12.39
Are there recycling stations like this one where you live?

Summary

• Conservation is a very effective way to help us to have useful materials in the future.
• To conserve, follow the three R’s: reduce, reuse, recycle.
• Reduce means to just use less.
• Reuse means to use something again, pass it on to someone who will, or change it so that it can be used in

another way.

• Recycle means to have it recycled in your community. This is great; although, it does take energy.

Summary

Natural resources include energy, minerals and other materials. Natural resources may be renewable or non-
renewable. Non-renewable resources cannot be replaced. When they’re gone, they’re gone. Renewable resources
can be replaced. They can supply human activities forever. Fossil fuels are crucial for modern human society.
Fossil fuels are essential for transportation, industry and agriculture. Renewable energy resources tend to be clean.
They emit fewer pollutants and greenhouse gases than fossil fuels. Renewable resources often have other problems.
They are more costly and less efﬁcient than fossil fuels. Still, they have many advantages. Research is going
into developing renewable resources. Conservation is the best way to increase resource availability. Anyone can
conserve! You and your family can. Society can. The world can. Just reduce, reuse, recycle.

Introduction

Chapter 13. The Solar System

How well do humans know the solar system?
Humans have been exploring the solar system for centuries. Mostly we have used telescopes or simply our eyes. But
the Sun, all of the planets, and many dwarf planets, asteroids and comets have been studied more closely. Spaceships
have taken rovers, probes or other technologies to study these bodies. Sometimes a spacecraft just ﬂies by to take
a look. So while it’s very difﬁcult to get humans very far from Earth, our spacecraft have become our eyes. We
know an incredible amount about the solar system compared with even a few decades ago. This is because of the
tremendous spacecraft and the instruments they carry. In this concept, we will explore a small fraction of what
scientists have learned about our solar system.

• Describe the basic properties of the Sun.

How can we learn about something as hot as the Sun?
Humans have sent spacecraft up to study our star. The SOHO spacecraft has been in operation since 1996. The craft
orbits the Sun in step with Earth but closer to it. SOHO has sent back amazing images. Onboard instruments have
also sent back mountains of data. The data is mostly about the Sun’s outer layers.

The Sun

Our Sun is a star, a sphere of plasma held together by gravity. It is an ordinary star that is extraordinarily important.
The Sun provides light and heat to our planet. This star supports almost all life on Earth.
The Sun is the center of the solar system, which includes all of the planets and other bodies that orbit it. It is by far
the largest part of the solar system ( Figure 13.1). Added together, all of the planets make up just 0.2 percent of the
solar system’s mass. The Sun makes up the remaining 99.8 percent of all the mass in the solar system!

13.2 Interior of the Sun

• Describe the internal layers of the Sun.

What does the Sun look like?
Different instruments pick up different features of the Sun. None can show us the Sun’s interior. But studies from
the SOHO spacecraft and other craft allow us to study the interior. We know a surprising amount about a body that
is so hot and so far away.

Layers of the Sun

The Sun is made almost entirely of the elements hydrogen and helium. The Sun has no solid material. Most atoms
in the Sun exist as plasma. Plasma is superheated gas with an electrical charge. Because the Sun is made of gases,
it does not have a deﬁned outer boundary. Like Earth, the Sun has an internal structure. The inner three layers make
up what we would actually call “the Sun.”

Internal Structure

Because the Sun is not solid, it does not have a deﬁned outer boundary. It does, however, have a deﬁnite internal
structure with identiﬁable layers ( Figure 13.2). Since the layers are not solid, the boundaries are fuzzy and indistinct.
From inward to outward, the layers are: the core, the radiative zone, and the convection zone.

982

www.ck12.org

Chapter 13. The Solar System

FIGURE 13.2
The layers of the Sun.

The Core

The core is the Sun’s innermost layer. The core is plasma. It has a temperature of around 15 million degrees Celsius
(°C). Nuclear fusion reactions create the immense temperature. In these reactions, hydrogen atoms fuse to form
helium. This releases vast amounts of energy. The energy moves toward the outer layers of the Sun. Energy from
the Sun’s core powers most of the solar system.

Radiative Zone

The radiative zone is the next layer out. It has a temperature of about 4 million °C. Energy from the core travels
through the radiative zone. The energy travels at an extremely slow rate. Light particles are called photons. In the
radiative zone, photons can only travel a few millimeters before they hit another particle. The particles are absorbed
and then released again. It may take 50 million years for a photon to travel all the way through the radiative zone.

The Convection Zone

The convection zone surrounds the radiative zone. In the convection zone, hot material from near the Sun’s center
rises. This material cools at the surface and then plunges back downward. The material then receives more heat from
the radiative zone. The ﬁrst video describes the basics of our Sun, including how it is powered by nuclear reactions:

13.3 Outer Layers of the Sun

• Describe the internal and atmospheric layers of the Sun.

What can you see during a solar eclipse?
A solar eclipse is kind of like a ﬁeld trip to the Sun from Earth. You can see something (with special tinted glasses)
that you don’t usually see. The Sun has a remarkable ring of light around it. This is the corona. If you have a chance
to see a solar eclipse, you should do it.

The Outer Layers

The three outer layers of the Sun are its atmosphere. The layers are, from inside to outside, the photosphere, the
chromosphere, and the corona.

The Photosphere

The photosphere is the visible surface of the Sun ( Figure 13.3). It’s the part that we see shining. Surprisingly, the
photosphere is also one of the coolest layers of the Sun. It is only about 6,000°C.

The Chromosphere

The chromosphere ( Figure 13.4) lies above the photosphere. It is about 2,000 km thick. The thin chromosphere is
heated by energy from the photosphere. Temperatures range from about 4,000°C to about 10,000°C. The chromo-
sphere is not as hot as other parts of the Sun, and it glows red. Jets of gas sometimes ﬂy up through the chromosphere.
With speeds up to 72,000 km per hour, the jets can ﬂy as high as 10,000 km.

tosphere,

FIGURE 13.4
The chromosphere.

The Corona

The corona ( Figure 13.5) is the outermost part of the Sun’s atmosphere. It is the Sun’s halo, or “crown.” With a
temperature of 1 to 3 million K, the corona is much hotter than the photosphere. The corona extends millions of
kilometers into space. Sometime you should try to see a total solar eclipse. If you do, you will see the Sun’s corona
shining out into space.
The movie "Seeing a Star in a New Light" can be seen here: http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/youtube.php .

13.4 Surface Features of the Sun

• Describe the major features of the Sun’s surface.

Is the Sun always the same?
For most of human history, people thought the Sun didn’t change much. But technology has offered us a window
into the Sun’s life. SOHO and other technologies allow us to observe incredible sunspots, ﬂares, and prominences.
Some of these are featured in this concept.

Surface Features of the Sun

The Sun has many incredible surface features. Don’t try to look at them, though! Looking directly at the Sun can
cause blindness. Find the appropriate ﬁlters for a pair of binoculars or a telescope and enjoy!

Sunspots

The most noticeable magnetic activity of the Sun is the appearance of sunspots. Sunspots are cooler, darker areas on
the Sun’s surface ( Figure 13.6). Sunspots occur in an 11-year cycle. The number of sunspots begins at a minimum.
The number gradually increases to the maximum. Then the number returns to a minimum again.
Sunspots form because loops of the Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld break through the surface. Sunspots usually occur in pairs.
The loop breaks through the surface where it comes out of the Sun. It breaks through again where it goes back into
the Sun. Sunspots disrupt the transfer of heat from the Sun’s lower layers.

Chapter 13. The Solar System

FIGURE 13.6
The darker regions in this image are sunspots.

Solar Flares

A loop of the Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld may break. This creates solar ﬂares. Solar ﬂares are violent explosions that
release huge amounts of energy ( Figure 13.7). The streams of high energy particles they emit make up the solar
wind. Solar wind is dangerous to spacecraft and astronauts. Solar ﬂares can even cause damage on Earth. They have
knocked out entire power grids and can disturb radio, satellite, and cell phone communications.

FIGURE 13.7
The solar ﬂare is the bright area in the lower right.

Solar Prominences

Another amazing feature on the Sun is solar prominences. Plasma ﬂows along the loop that connects sunspots. This
plasma forms a glowing arch. The arch is a solar prominence. Solar prominences can reach thousands of kilometers
into the Sun’s atmosphere. Prominences can last for a day to several months. Prominences can be seen during a total
solar eclipse.

Solar Dynamics Observatory

NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched on February 11, 2010. SDO is studying the Sun’s
magnetic ﬁeld. This includes how the Sun affects Earth’s atmosphere and climate. SDO provides extremely high
resolution images. The craft gathers data faster than anything that ever studied the Sun.

Summary

• Sunspots occur in pairs. Each is one side of a loop of the Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld on the Sun’s surface. Sunspots

come and go on an 11-year cycle.

• Sunspots are cooler and darker than the rest of the Sun’s surface. They are marked by intense magnetic activity.
• Solar prominences are the plasma loops that connect two sunspots.
• Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections are eruptions of highly energetic particles from the Sun’s surface.

Can humans take a ﬁeld trip through the solar system?
A ﬁeld trip through the solar system would take a long time. It took 12 years for the Voyager spacecraft to get from
Earth to Neptune. If a human was on board, he or she would probably want to come back! Fortunately, unmanned
spacecrafts can send back images of far distant places in the solar system.

Solar System Objects

Astronomers now recognize eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), ﬁve
dwarf planets (Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris), more than 150 moons, and many, many asteroids and
other small objects ( Figure 13.8). These objects move in regular and predictable paths around the Sun.

Distances in the solar system are often measured in astronomical units (AU). One astronomical unit is deﬁned as
the distance from Earth to the Sun. 1 AU equals about 150 million km (93 million miles). Listed below is the
distance from the Sun to each planet in AU ( Table 13.2). The table shows how long it takes each planet to spin once
on its axis. It also shows how long it takes each planet to complete an orbit. Notice how slowly Venus rotates! A
day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus!

13.6 Inner versus Outer Planets

• Compare and contrast the inner and outer planets.

What’s better than a ﬁeld trip?
All of the inner planets are orbited by man-made satellites. Jupiter and Saturn have man-made satellites too. We
can see what the planets look like from the photos they take. The satellites also carry instruments that collect a lot
of important data. This is better than taking a ﬁeld trip to such hostile places. You can learn a lot while sitting your
own, very comfortable planet!

The Inner Planets

The four planets closest to the Sun—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are the inner planets or terrestrial planets
( Figure 13.10). They are similar to Earth. All are solid, dense, and rocky. None of the inner planets has rings.
Compared to the outer planets, the inner planets are small. They have shorter orbits around the Sun and they spin
more slowly. Venus spins backward and spins the slowest of all the planets.
All of the inner planets were geologically active at one time. They are all made of cooled igneous rock with inner
iron cores. Earth has one big, round moon, while Mars has two very small, irregular moons. Mercury and Venus do
not have moons.

The Outer Planets

Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are the outer planets of our solar system. These are the four planets farthest
from the Sun. The outer planets are much larger than the inner planets. Since they are mostly made of gases, they

are also called gas giants. Pictured below are the relative sizes of the outer planets and the Sun ( Figure 13.11)

FIGURE 13.11
This image shows the four outer planets
and the Sun, with sizes to scale. From
left to right, the outer planets are Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

The gas giants are mostly made of hydrogen and helium. These are the same elements that make up most of the Sun.
Astronomers think that most of the nebula was hydrogen and helium. The inner planets lost these very light gases.
Their gravity was too low to keep them, and they ﬂoated away into space. The Sun and the outer planets had enough
gravity to keep the hydrogen and helium.
All of the outer planets have numerous moons. They also have planetary rings made of dust and other small
particles. Only the rings of Saturn can be easily seen from Earth.

Summary

• The four inner planets have slower orbits, slower spin, no rings, and they are made of rock and metal.
• The four outer planets have faster orbits and spins, a composition of gases and liquids, numerous moons, and

rings.

• The outer planets are made of hydrogen and helium, so they are called gas giants.

13.7 Mercury

• Describe the characteristics of Mercury.

What does this planet look like?
Mercury looks a lot like Earth’s Moon. Why do you think it does? Both have been struck by a lot of asteroids. Both
have no atmosphere, so there is no weathering and erosion. If they had an atmosphere, many of the craters would
have been eroded away. Both have no plate tectonics to transform the landscape. This would also remove a lot of
craters.

Mercury

Mercury is the smallest planet. It has no moon. It is also the planet closest to the Sun. Pictured below is the surface
of Mercury covered with craters ( Figure 13.12), like Earth’s Moon. Many of the impact craters are billions of years
old. This means that Mercury hasn’t changed much geologically for billions of years. It has no plate tectonics. With
only a trace of an atmosphere, it has no weather to wear down the ancient craters.

Exploring Mercury

Because Mercury is so close to the Sun, it is difﬁcult to observe from Earth, even with a telescope. The Mariner
10 spacecraft did a ﬂyby of Mercury in 1974–1975. In 2004, the MESSENGER mission left Earth. On its way to
Mercury, it did one ﬂyby of Earth, two of Venus, and three of Mercury. In March 2011, MESSENGER became the
ﬁrst spacecraft to enter an orbit around Mercury. To date, MESSENGER has taken over 100,000 images and has
revealed many interesting features of the planet’s interior.

Chapter 13. The Solar System

FIGURE 13.12
The surface of Mercury is covered with craters, like Earth’s Moon.

Short Year, Long Days

Mercury is named for the Roman messenger god. Mercury was a messenger because he could run extremely fast.
The Greeks gave the planet this name because Mercury moves very quickly in its orbit around the Sun. Mercury
orbits the Sun in just 88 Earth days. Mercury has a very short year, but it also has very long days. Mercury rotates
slowly on its axis, turning exactly three times for every two times it orbits the Sun. Therefore, each day on Mercury
is 58 Earth days long.

Extreme Temperatures

Mercury is very close to the Sun, so it can get very hot. Mercury also has virtually no atmosphere. As the planet
rotates very slowly, the temperature varies tremendously. In direct sunlight, the surface can be as hot as 427°C
(801°F). On the dark side, the surface can be as cold as –183°C (–297°F)! The coldest temperatures may be on the
insides of craters. Most of Mercury is extremely dry. Scientists think that there may be a small amount of water, in
the form of ice, at the planet’s poles. The poles never receive direct sunlight.

A Liquid Metal Core

Pictured below is a diagram of Mercury’s interior ( Figure 13.13). Mercury is one of the densest planets. Scientists
think that the interior contains a large core made mostly of melted iron. The inner core may be solid. Mercury’s core
takes up about 85% of the planet’s radius.

Summary

• Mercury appears to be moving rapidly because it’s so close to the Sun.
• Mercury has short years, just 88 Earth days. Mercury has long days, about 57 Earth days.
• Mercury is extremely hot and has a liquid metal core.

13.8 Venus

• Describe the characteristics of Venus.

What’s beneath Venus’s clouds?
This image was produced by the Magellan probe on a ﬂyby. Radar waves sent by the spacecraft reveal mountains,
valleys, vast lava plains, and canyons. The colors are not real. They enhance the features so we can better see them.

Venus

Named after the Roman goddess of love, Venus is the only planet named after a female. Venus is sometimes called
Earth’s “sister planet.” Venus is our nearest neighbor and is most like Earth in size. But Venus is a lot different from
Earth. Earth’s life would not ﬁnd the planet very hospitable at all.

A Harsh Environment

Viewed through a telescope, Venus looks smooth and featureless. The planet is covered by a thick layer of clouds.
You can see the clouds in pictures of Venus ( Figure 13.14).

1001

13.8. Venus

www.ck12.org

FIGURE 13.14
Venus in real color. The planet is covered by a thick layer of clouds.

We make maps of the surface using radar because the thick clouds won’t allow us to take photographs of the surface
of Venus. This is shown in the ﬁrst image at the top.

Atmosphere

Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus’s clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide,
sulfur dioxide, and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! Scientists think the color of sunlight on Venus is
reddish-brown.
The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times
greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result,
Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is even much hotter than Mercury.
Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead!

Surface

The surface of Venus is shrouded by thick clouds. Radar images show a complex surface. There are volcanoes and
craters like those found on other planets and moons. The surface is not nearly as complex as the surface of Earth.

Craters

There are a large number of craters on Venus. However, there are not nearly as many as on Mercury or the Moon. So
the planet’s surface must be fairly young. This suggests that the planet experiences volcanism and has a hot interior.

Volcanoes

Venus has more volcanoes than any other planet. There are between 100,000 and one million volcanoes on Venus!
Most of the volcanoes are now inactive.
Pictured below is an image made using radar data ( Figure 13.15). The volcano is Maat Mons. Lava beds are in the
foreground.

Chapter 13. The Solar System

FIGURE 13.15

foreground.

Motion and Appearance

Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise as viewed from its North Pole. All of the other planets rotate
counterclockwise. Venus turns slowly, making only one turn every 243 days. This is longer than a year on Venus! It
takes Venus only 225 days to orbit the Sun.
Because the orbit of Venus is inside Earth’s orbit, Venus always appears close to the Sun. You can see Venus rising
early in the morning, just before the Sun rises ( Figure 13.16). For this reason, Venus is sometimes called “the
morning star.” When it sets in the evening, just after the Sun sets, it may be called “the evening star.” Since planets
only reﬂect the Sun’s light, Venus should not be called a star at all! Venus is very bright because its clouds reﬂect
sunlight very well. Venus is the brightest object in the sky besides the Sun and the Moon.

FIGURE 13.16
Venus (right) and the Moon (left) just be-
fore sunrise.

Like Mercury, but unlike Earth, Venus does not have a moon.

Summary

• Venus has a very thick, toxic atmosphere.
• Venus has lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The atmosphere has a very strong greenhouse effect and

therefore traps a lot of heat.

• Venus has fewer impact craters than Mercury or the Moon. Venus has a lot of volcanoes, including some very

large ones.

13.9 Moon

• Describe the characteristics of Earth’s Moon.

Would you like to go on this ﬁeld trip?
The most amazing "ﬁeld trips" in human history took place in the Apollo program. Between 1969 and 1972, six
manned spaceships landed on the Moon. Human astronauts walked on the Moon. They brought back soil and rock
samples. No human has visited Earth’s satellite since 1972. There is talk of someday returning, but there are no
concrete plans.

Earth’s Moon

The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite. The Moon is about one-fourth the size of Earth, 3,476 kilometers in
diameter. Gravity on the Moon is only one-sixth as strong as it is on Earth. If you weigh 120 pounds on Earth, you
would only weigh 20 pounds on the Moon. You can jump six times as high on the Moon as you can on Earth. The
Moon makes no light of its own. Like every other body in the solar system, it only reﬂects light from the Sun.

1005

13.9. Moon

Orbit

www.ck12.org

The Moon rotates on its axis once for every orbit it makes around Earth. What does this mean? This means that the
same side of the Moon always faces Earth. The side of the Moon that always faces Earth is called the near side. The
side of the Moon that always faces away from Earth is called the far side. From Earth, people have only seen the
Moon’s near side. The far side has only been seen by spacecraft and Apollo astronauts.

Atmosphere

The Moon has no atmosphere. With no atmosphere, the Moon is not protected from extreme temperatures. The
average surface temperature during the day is approximately 107°C (225°F). Daytime temperatures can reach as high
as 123°C (253°F). At night, the average temperature drops to -153°C (-243°F). The lowest temperatures measured
are as low as -233°C (-397°F).

Lunar Surface

We all know what the Moon looks like. It’s always looked the same during our lifetime. In fact, the Moon has looked
the same to every person who has looked up at it for all time. Even the dinosaurs, trilobites, or cyanobacteria, should
they have looked up at it, would have seen more-or-less the same thing. This is not true of Earth. Natural processes
continually alter Earth’s surface. Without these processes, would Earth’s surface resemble the Moon’s? The Moon
does have more craters than it did in the long distant past, of course.
Even though we can’t see it from Earth, the Moon has changed recently too. Astronauts’ footprints are now on the
Moon. They will remain unchanged for thousands of years, because there is no wind, rain, or living thing to disturb
them. A falling meteorite could destroy them. Tiny micrometeorites bombard the Moon’s surface and smooth it over
time too.

Craters

The landscape of the Moon—its surface features—is very different from Earth. The lunar landscape is covered
by craters caused by meteoroid impacts ( Figure 13.17). ( Lunar means relating to the Moon.) The craters are
bowl-shaped basins on the Moon’s surface. Because the Moon has no water, wind, or weather, the craters remain
unchanged.
The Moon’s coldest temperatures are found deep in the craters. The coldest craters are at the south pole on the
Moon’s far side. The Sun never shines on the bottoms of the deepest craters. These temperatures are amongst the
coldest in our entire solar system.

Maria

Chapter 13. The Solar System

When you look at the Moon from Earth, you notice dark and light areas. The maria are dark, solid, ﬂat areas of
lava (mostly basalt). Maria covers around 16% of the Moon’s surface, mostly on the near side. The maria formed
about 3.0 to 4.0 billion years ago, when the Moon was continually bombarded by meteoroids ( Figure 13.18). Large
meteorites broke through the Moon’s newly formed surface. This eventually caused magma to ﬂow out and ﬁll the
craters. Scientists estimate volcanic activity on the Moon ended about 1.2 billion years ago.

FIGURE 13.18
Maria (the dark areas) and terrae (the light areas) cover the Moon.

Terrae

The lighter parts on the Moon are called terrae, or highlands ( Figure 13.18). They are higher than the maria and
include several high mountain ranges. The rock that makes up the highlands is mostly composed of feldspar, which
is lighter in color and crystallized more slowly than the maria. The rock looks light because it reﬂects more of the
Sun’s light.
The ﬁgure below shows the near and far sides of the Moon ( Figure 13.19). They are different!

FIGURE 13.19
The Mare Moscoviense is one of the few
maria, or dark, ﬂat areas, on the far side.

The rocks of the terrae formed while the lunar magma ocean cooled just after the Moon formed. The maria formed
later.

13.9. Moon

Water

www.ck12.org

There are no lakes, rivers, or even small puddles anywhere to be found on the Moon’s surface. So there is no running
water and no atmosphere. This means that there is no erosion. Natural processes continually alter Earth’s surface.
Without these processes, our planet’s surface would be covered with meteorite craters just like the Moon. Many
moons in our solar system have cratered surfaces.
NASA scientists have discovered a large number of water molecules mixed in with lunar dirt. There is also surface
water ice in some of the frigid places that are always in shadow. Even though there is a very small amount of water,
there is no atmosphere. Temperatures are extreme. So it comes as no surprise that there has not been evidence of
life on the Moon.

Lunar Interior

Like Earth, the Moon has a distinct crust, mantle, and core. The crust is composed of igneous rock. This rock is
rich in the elements oxygen, silicon, magnesium, and aluminum. On the near side, the Moon’s crust is about 30
kilometers thick. On the far side, the crust is about 100 kilometers thick. The mantle is made of rock like Earth’s
upper mantle. The Moon has a small metallic core, perhaps 300 to 500 kilometers in diameter. The composition of
the core is probably mostly iron with some sulfur and nickel. We learned this both from the rock samples gathered
by astronauts and from spacecraft sent to the Moon.

Exploration

Humans have walked on only two planetary bodies: Earth and the Moon. The footprints the men left behind are the
ﬁrst signs of life ever on the Moon. Scientists learned a great deal about the Moon from the Apollo missions. The
samples that were brought back have been studied in laboratories. We know an incredible amount about the Moon
because of these samples. Having these rocks radically changed our thinking about the Moon.
The Moon is easily seen from Earth. Early astronomers used telescopes to study and map its surface. The Moon
has also seen a great number of satellites, rovers, and orbiters. After all, it is relatively easy to get spacecraft to the
satellite. Also, before humans could be safely sent to the Moon, many studies and experiments had to be completed.

Summary

• The Moon revolves around Earth as they orbit the Sun. The same side of Moon always faces Earth.
• The lunar surface has dark basalt maria. The light highlands are called terrae.
• The Moon has a crust, mantle, and core.
• The Moon has no atmosphere and only a very tiny amount of water.

13.10 Mars

• Describe the characteristics of Mars.

How do we get such incredible views of other planets?
Mars is close, and it’s not obscured by its atmosphere like Venus is. The Hubble Space Telescope took this incredible
photo of Mars. This is a true color photo: the red is soil, the white is the polar ice cap, the dark is basalt. Mars has
many features like Earth’s, but Mars is missing one very important feature: an ocean.

Mars

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The Red Planet is the ﬁrst planet beyond Earth’s orbit.
Mars’ atmosphere is thin compared to Earth’s. This means that there is much lower pressure at the surface. Mars
also has a weak greenhouse effect, so temperatures are only slightly higher than they would be if the planet did not
have an atmosphere. The Martian climate is most like Earth’s of any planet in the solar system.

Mars is the easiest planet to observe. As a result, it has been studied more than any other planet besides Earth.
People can stand on Earth and observe the planet through a telescope. We have also sent many space probes to Mars.
A car-sized robotic rover, Curiosity, arrived on the Red Planet in August 2012. Curiosity joins Opportunity, which
has been active since 2004.
No humans have ever set foot on Mars. NASA and the European Space Agency have plans to send people to Mars.
The goal is to do it sometime between 2030 and 2040. The expense and danger of these missions are phenomenal.

Surface Features

Mars has mountains, canyons, and other features similar to Earth. But it doesn’t have as much geological activity as
Earth. There is no evidence of plate tectonics on Mars. There are also more craters on Mars than on Earth. But there
are fewer craters than on the Moon. What does this suggest to you regarding Mars’ tectonic history? Pictured below
is an image of the Martian surface ( Figure 13.20).

FIGURE 13.20
Mars is Earth’s second nearest neighbor planet.

A Red Planet

Viewed from Earth, Mars is red. This is due to large amounts of iron in the soil. The ancient Greeks and Romans
named the planet Mars after the god of war because the planet’s red color reminded them of blood. Mars has only a
very thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide.

Volcanoes

Mars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system: Olympus Mons ( Figure 13.21). Olympus Mons is a shield
volcano. The volcano is similar to the volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands. But Olympus Mons is a giant, about 27
km (16.8 miles; 88,580 ft) tall. That’s three times taller than Mount Everest! At its base, Olympus Mons is about
the size of the entire state of Arizona, about 624 km (374 miles) across.

Canyons

Mars also has the largest canyon in the solar system, Valles Marineris ( Figure 13.22). This canyon is 4,000 km
(2,500 miles) long. That’s as long as Europe is wide! One-ﬁfth of the circumference of Mars is covered by the
canyon. Valles Marineris is 7 km (4.3 miles) deep. How about Earth’s Grand Canyon? Earth’s most famous canyon
is only 446 km (277 miles) long and about 2 km (1.2 miles) deep. Valles Marineris is thought to be a tectonic crack
in the Martian crust.

FIGURE 13.22
The largest canyon in the solar system, Valles Marineris

Is There Water on Mars?

Water on Mars can’t be a liquid. This is because the pressure of the atmosphere is too low. The planet does have a
lot of water; it is in the form of ice. The south pole of Mars has a very visible ice cap. Scientists also have evidence
that there is also a lot of ice just under the Martian surface. The ice melts when volcanoes erupt. At these times
liquid water ﬂows across the surface.
Curiosity, the rover, has found evidence of a ﬂowing stream on Mars. Layers of smooth, water-polished pebbles have
been photographed. This is exactly what you would see in a stream on Earth. There are many surface features that
look like water-eroded canyons. Since there was liquid water on Mars, scientists think that life might have existed
there in the past. One of Curiosity’s tasks is to sample the soil to search for carbon and other evidence of life.

Two Martian Moons

Mars has two very small, irregular moons, Phobos ( Figure 13.23) and Deimos. These moons were discovered in
1877. They are named after the two sons of Ares, who followed their father into war. The moons were probably
asteroids that were captured by Martian gravity.

Summary

• Mars is the easiest planet to study because it doesn’t have thick clouds obscuring its surface. It is also close to

Earth.

13.11 Jupiter

• Describe the characteristics of Jupiter.

What are Jupiter’s most distinctive features?
Jupiter has been well studied for being so far away. Many ﬂybys, one orbiter, and a probe have all visited the planet.
While the possibility exists for humans to reach Mars, a manned trip to Jupiter seems a long ways away. The round
trip would take at least 10 years. Who would want to spend more than a decade on a spaceship? At least they could
see the Great Red Spot and other features in person!

Jupiter

Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. Jupiter is named for the king of the gods in Roman mythology. The
Romans named the largest planet for their most important god. They followed the tradition of the Greeks, who had
similarly named the planet Zeus. The Romans built a temple to Jupiter on the hill.
Jupiter is truly a giant! The planet has 318 times the mass of Earth, and over 1,300 times Earth’s volume. So Jupiter
is much less dense than Earth. Because Jupiter is so large, it reﬂects a lot of sunlight. When it is visible, it is the

1014

www.ck12.org

Chapter 13. The Solar System

brightest object in the night sky besides the Moon and Venus. Jupiter is quite far from Earth. The planet is more
than ﬁve times as far from Earth as the Sun. It takes Jupiter about 12 Earth years to orbit once around the Sun.

A Ball of Gas and Liquid

Since Jupiter is a gas giant, could a spacecraft land on its surface? The answer is no. There is no solid surface at all!
Jupiter is made mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of other elements. The outer layers of
the planet are gas. Deeper within the planet, the intense pressure condenses the gases into a liquid. Jupiter may have
a small rocky core at its center.

A Stormy Atmosphere

Jupiter’s atmosphere is unlike any other in the solar system! The upper layer contains clouds of ammonia. The
ammonia is different colored bands. These bands rotate around the planet. The ammonia also swirls around in
tremendous storms. The Great Red Spot ( Figure 13.24) is Jupiter’s most noticeable feature. The spot is an enor-
mous, oval-shaped storm. It is more than three times as wide as Earth! Clouds in the storm rotate counterclockwise.
They make one complete turn every six days or so. The Great Red Spot has been on Jupiter for at least 300 years.
It may have been observed as early as 1664. It is possible that this storm is a permanent feature on Jupiter. No one
knows for sure.

FIGURE 13.24
The Great Red Spot has been on Jupiter since we’ve had telescopes
powerful enough to see it.

Moons and Rings

Jupiter has lots of moons. As of 2012, we have discovered over 66 natural satellites of Jupiter. Four are big enough
and bright enough to be seen from Earth using a pair of binoculars. These four moons were ﬁrst discovered by
Galileo in 1610. They are called the Galilean moons. The ﬁgure below shows the four Galilean moons and their
sizes relative to each other ( Figure 13.25). These moons are named Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The
Galilean moons are larger than even the biggest dwarf planets, Pluto and Eris. Ganymede is the biggest moon in the
solar system. It is even larger than the planet Mercury!
Scientists think that Europa is a good place to look for extraterrestrial life. Europa is the smallest of the Galilean
moons. The moon’s surface is a smooth layer of ice. Scientists think that the ice may sit on top of an ocean of liquid
water. How could Europa have liquid water when it is so far from the Sun? Europa is heated by Jupiter. Jupiter’s
tidal forces are so great that they stretch and squash its moon. This could produce enough heat for there to be liquid
water. Numerous missions have been planned to explore Europa, including plans to drill through the ice and send a
probe into the ocean. However, no such mission has yet been attempted.
Photos from the Voyager missions showed that Jupiter has a ring system. This ring system is very faint, so it is very
difﬁcult to observe from Earth.

Exploration

Jupiter has fascinated scientists at least since Galileo turned his ﬁrst telescope on the planet. In 1979, two spacecrafts,
Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, visited Jupiter and its moons. The Galileo orbiter orbited the planet for seven years and
ﬂew by all of the Galilean moons plus one other moon. The orbiter released a probe to study the planet’s atmosphere.
Future missions to Jupiter are underway. Juno will arrive in late 2016.

Summary

• Jupiter is mostly hydrogen with some helium, and may contain a small rocky core.
• Jupiter has a thick atmosphere. The Great Red Spot is a storm that has been going for at least 300 years.
• One of Jupiter’s moons, Europa, appears to have a liquid ocean beneath the surface. This ocean could be a

place for life.

13.12 Saturn

• Describe the characteristics of Saturn.

If you could take a trip to Saturn, what would you see?
This storm was captured by the Cassini spacecraft. It was the most intense storm seen on Saturn since Cassini began
orbiting Saturn eight years ago. The storm went on for several weeks. Of course, a human orbiting Saturn might be
most fascinated by the planet’s beautiful rings.

Saturn

Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system ( Figure 13.26). Saturn’s mass is about 95 times Earth’s
mass. The gas giant is 755 times Earth’s volume. Despite its large size, Saturn is the least dense planet in our solar
system. Saturn is actually less dense than water. This means that if there were a bathtub big enough, Saturn would
ﬂoat! In Roman mythology, Saturn was the father of Jupiter. Saturn orbits the Sun once about every 30 Earth years.

Chapter 13. The Solar System

FIGURE 13.26
Saturn is the least dense planet in our solar system.

Composition

Saturn’s composition is similar to Jupiter’s. The planet is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. These elements are
gases in the outer layers and liquids in the deeper layers. Saturn may also have a small solid core. Saturn’s upper
atmosphere has clouds in bands of different colors. These clouds rotate rapidly around the planet. But Saturn has
fewer storms than Jupiter. Thunder and lightning have been seen in the storms on Saturn.

Rings

Saturn’s rings were ﬁrst observed by Galileo in 1610. Remember that his telescope was not very good. He didn’t
know they were rings and thought that they were two large moons. One moon was on either side of the planet. In
1659, the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens realized that they were rings circling Saturn’s equator. The rings
appear tilted. This is because Saturn is tilted about 27 degrees to its side.
The Voyager 1 spacecraft visited Saturn in 1980. Voyager 2 followed in 1981. These probes sent back detailed
pictures of Saturn, its rings, and some of its moons ( Figure 13.27). From the Voyager data, we learned what
Saturn’s rings are made of. They are particles of water and ice with a little bit of dust. There are several gaps in the
rings. These gaps were cleared out by moons within the rings. Gravity attracts dust and gas to the moon from the
ring. This leaves a gap in the rings. Other gaps in the rings are caused by the competing forces of Saturn and its
moons outside the rings.

FIGURE 13.27
The rings of Saturn.

Scientists think that there are two possibilities for how Saturn’s rings formed. One possibility is by the breakup
of one of Saturn’s moons. The other possibility is from material that never made it into the planet when Saturn
originally formed.
An animation of dark spokes in Saturn’s rings is seen here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Saturn_ring_spokes

Moons

As of 2012, 62 natural moons have been identiﬁed around Saturn. Only seven of Saturn’s moons are round. All but
one is smaller than Earth’s moon. Some of the very small moons are found within the rings. All the particles in the
rings are like little moons, because they orbit around Saturn. Someone must decide which ones are large enough to
call moons.
Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, is about one and a half times the size of Earth’s moon. Titan is even larger than the
planet Mercury. The picture below compares the size of Titan to Earth ( Figure 13.28). Scientists are very interested
in Titan. The moon has an atmosphere that is thought to be like Earth’s ﬁrst atmosphere with nitrogen and methane.
This atmosphere was around before life developed on Earth. Like Jupiter’s moon, Europa, Titan may have a layer
of liquid water under a layer of ice. Scientists now think that there are lakes on Titan’s surface. Don’t take a dip,
though. These lakes contain liquid methane and ethane instead of water! Methane and ethane are compounds found
in natural gas.

This composite image compares Saturn’s largest moon, Titan (right), to
Earth (left).

Summary

• Like Jupiter, Saturn is made of hydrogen and helium.
• Saturn’s rings are composed of water and ice, with some dust and rock.
• Saturn’s moon Titan is interesting to scientists because of its composition and liquid ocean.

13.13 Uranus

• Describe the characteristics of Uranus.

What is this blue ball?
Uranus is so far away that there has been relatively little exploration of the planet. The closest approach was a ﬂyby
by Voyager 2 in 1986. Great images have also been taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.

Uranus

Uranus is named for the Greek god of the sky, the father of Saturn. Astronomers pronounce the name “YOOR-
uh-nuhs.” Uranus was not known to ancient observers. The planet was ﬁrst discovered with a telescope by the
astronomer William Herschel in 1781.
Uranus is faint because it is very far away. Its distance from the Sun is 2.8 billion kilometers (1.8 billion miles). A
photon from the Sun takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes to reach Uranus. Uranus orbits the Sun once about every
84 Earth years.

An Icy Blue-Green Ball

Chapter 13. The Solar System

Uranus is a lot like Jupiter and Saturn. The planet is composed in part of hydrogen and helium. There is a thick
layer of gas on the outside. Farther on the inside is liquid. But Uranus has a higher percentage of icy materials than
Jupiter and Saturn. These materials include water, ammonia, and methane. Uranus is also different because of its
blue-green color. Clouds of methane ﬁlter out red light. This leaves a blue-green color. The atmosphere of Uranus
has bands of clouds. These clouds are hard to see in normal light. The result is that the planet looks like a plain blue
ball.
Uranus is the least massive outer planet. Its mass is only about 14 times the mass of Earth. Like all of the outer
planets, Uranus is much less dense than Earth. Gravity is actually weaker than on Earth’s surface. If you were at the
top of the clouds on Uranus, you would weigh about 10 percent less than what you weigh on Earth.

The Sideways Planet

All of the planets rotate on their axes in the same direction that they move around the Sun. Except for Uranus.
Uranus is tilted on its side. Its axis is almost parallel to its orbit. So Uranus rolls along like a bowling ball as it
revolves around the Sun. How did Uranus get this way? Scientists think that the planet was struck and knocked over
by another planet-sized object. This collision probably took place billions of years ago.

Rings and Moons of Uranus

Uranus has a faint system of rings ( Figure 13.29). The rings circle the planet’s equator. However, Uranus is tilted
on its side. So the rings are almost perpendicular to the planet’s orbit.

FIGURE 13.29
This image from the Hubble Space Telescope uses infrared light ﬁlters to
show the faint rings of Uranus.

We have discovered 27 moons around Uranus. All but a few are named for characters from the plays of William
Shakespeare. The ﬁve largest moons of Uranus, Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon, are pictured below (
Figure 13.30).

• Describe the characteristics of Neptune.

Does this photo give you an idea of how Neptune got its name?
Because of its blue color, Neptune was named for the Roman god of the sea. The blue is not a planetary ocean
though!

Neptune

Neptune ( Figure 13.31) is the eighth planet from the Sun. Neptune is so far away you need a telescope to see it
from Earth. Neptune is the most distant planet in our solar system. It is nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion
miles) from the Sun. One orbit around the Sun takes Neptune 165 Earth years.

Discovery

Scientists guessed Neptune’s existence before it was discovered. Uranus did not always appear exactly where it
should. They said this was because a planet beyond Uranus was pulling on it. This gravitational pull was affecting
its orbit. Neptune was discovered in 1846. It was just where scientists predicted it would be!

13.14. Neptune

FIGURE 13.31
Neptune has a great dark spot at the center left and a small dark spot at
the bottom center.

Uranus and Neptune are often considered “sister planets.” They are very similar to each other. Neptune has slightly
more mass than Uranus, but it is slightly smaller in size.

Extremes of Cold and Wind

Like Uranus, Neptune is blue. The blue color is caused by gases in its atmosphere, including methane. Neptune
is not a smooth looking ball like Uranus. The planet has a few darker and lighter spots. When Voyager 2 visited
Neptune in 1986, there was a large dark-blue spot south of the equator. This spot was called the Great Dark Spot.
When the Hubble Space Telescope photographed Neptune in 1994, the Great Dark Spot had disappeared. Another
dark spot had appeared north of the equator. Astronomers believe that both of these spots represent gaps in the
methane clouds on Neptune.
Neptune’s appearance changes due to its turbulent atmosphere. Winds are stronger than on any other planet in the
solar system. Wind speeds can reach 1,100 km/h (700 mph). This is close to the speed of sound! The rapid winds
surprised astronomers. This is because Neptune receives little energy from the Sun to power weather systems. It is
not surprising that Neptune is one of the coldest places in the solar system. Temperatures at the top of the clouds are

Like the other outer planets, Neptune has rings of ice and dust. These rings are much thinner and fainter than
Saturn’s. Neptune’s rings may be unstable. They may change or disappear in a relatively short time.
Neptune has 13 known moons. Only Triton ( Figure 13.32) has enough mass to be round. Triton orbits in the
direction opposite Neptune’s orbit. Scientists think Triton did not form around Neptune. The satellite was captured
by Neptune’s gravity as it passed by.

13.15 Exoplanets

• Deﬁne exoplanet.
• Explain how scientists locate exoplanets.

Are you surprised by exoplanets?
Scientists have always thought there had to be planets outside our solar system. They just couldn’t see them. Now
that there are ways to ﬁnd exoplanets, it turns out that there are many of them. In this artist’s depiction, the star
Gliese 436 is a dwarf star and is reddish because it is cool. The planet has recently been discovered. It is the size of
Neptune and orbits its star every 2.6 days.

Extrasolar Planets

Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered other solar systems. A solar system has one or more planets
orbiting one or more stars. We call these planets “extrasolar planets,” or exoplanets. They are called exoplanets
because they orbit a star other than the Sun. As of April 2014, more than 4,600 exoplanets have been found, with
1706 conﬁrmed. The rate of discovery is increasing rapidly! You can check out how many we have found at http://p
lanetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/ .
Exoplanets are very far away, and they are relatively tiny. So we have been able to take pictures of only a few
exoplanets. Most are discovered because of some tell-tale signs. One sign is a very slight motion of a star that must
be caused by the pull of a planet.
An animation showing how this looks is seen here from above: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/
59/Orbit3.gif . This is in line with the plane of the system: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dopspec-inline.gif .
Another sign is the partial dimming of a star’s light as the planet passes in front of it.

Life

If life exists elsewhere in the Universe, it is almost certainly on an exoplanet. Which exoplanets could have life?
Probably those that are most like Earth. Kepler-22b is the Earth-zone of a Sun-like star. This means that the planet
is the right distance from its star for life. The planet could have liquid water, which is necessary for life on Earth.
Scientists do not know if there is life on Kepler-22b and won’t for a long time. It’s fun to think about though! An
artist’s depiction of Kepler-22b is pictured below ( Figure 13.34).

13.16 Asteroids

• Describe asteroids and the asteroid belt.
• Explain what effects asteroids may have on Earth and other planets.

Is this rock an asteroid?
This rock is somewhat round. It is called asteroid Vesta, but it may actually be a protoplanet: too round to be an
asteroid, not round enough to be a dwarf planet. This image was taken of Vesta as a spacecraft orbited it for a year.
Scientists are interested in asteroids for many reasons. They are remnants from the early solar system. Asteroids
sometimes cause mass extinctions.

Asteroids

After the Sun and planets formed, there was some material left over. These small chunks didn’t get close enough to
a large body to be pulled in by its gravity. They now inhabit the solar system as asteroids and comets.
Asteroids ( Figure 13.35) are very small, irregularly shaped, rocky bodies. Asteroids orbit the Sun, but they are
more like giant rocks than planets. Since they are small, they have features that are different from planets. Asteroids

1032

www.ck12.org

Chapter 13. The Solar System

do not have enough gravity to become round. They are too small to have an atmosphere. With no internal heat, they
are not geologically active.
An asteroid can only change due to a collision. A collision may cause the asteroid to break up. It may create craters
on the asteroid’s surface. An asteroid may strike a planet if it comes near enough to be pulled in by its gravity.

FIGURE 13.35
Asteroid Ida with its tiny moon Dactyl. The asteroid’s mean radius is 15.7
km.

The Asteroid Belt

Hundreds of thousands of asteroids have been found in our solar system. They are still being discovered at a rate
of about 5,000 new asteroids per month! The majority are located in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This
region is called the asteroid belt ( Figure 13.36). There are many thousands of asteroids in the asteroid belt. Still,
their total mass adds up to only about four percent of Earth’s Moon.
Asteroids formed at the same time as the rest of the solar system. Although there are many in the asteroid belt, they
were never able to form into a planet. Jupiter’s gravity kept them apart.

FIGURE 13.36
The asteroid belt is between Mars and
Jupiter.

13.16. Asteroids

Near-Earth Asteroids

www.ck12.org

Near-Earth asteroids have orbits that cross Earth’s orbit. This means that they can collide with Earth. There are
over 4,500 known near-Earth asteroids. Small asteroids do sometimes collide with Earth. An asteroid about 5–10 m
in diameter hits about once per year. Five hundred to a thousand of the known near-Earth asteroids are much bigger.
They are over 1 kilometer in diameter. When large asteroids hit Earth in the past, many organisms died. At times,
many species became extinct in a mass extinction. Astronomers keep looking for near-Earth asteroids. They hope
to predict a possible collision early so they can to try to stop it.

Asteroid Missions

Scientists are very interested in asteroids. Most are composed of material that has not changed since early in the
solar system. Scientists can learn a lot from them about how the solar system formed. Asteroids may be important
for space travel. They could be mined for rare minerals or for construction projects in space.
Scientists have sent spacecrafts to study asteroids. In 1997, the NEAR Shoemaker probe orbited the asteroid 433
Eros. The craft ﬁnally landed on its surface in 2001. The Japanese Hayabusa probe returned to Earth with samples
of a small near-Earth asteroid in 2010. The U.S. Dawn mission spent a year in orbit around Vesta ending in August
2012.

13.17 Comets

• Describe the characteristics of comets.
• Explain where comets come from.

Is this comet going to hit?
Astronauts on board the International Space Station witness incredible things. This photo of Comet Lovejoy was
taken in December 2011. Although it looks like its going to strike Earth, it was not even visible from our planet by
the naked eye. The comet is now traveling far out into space.

Comets

Comets are small, icy objects that have very elliptical orbits around the Sun. Their orbits carry them from the outer
solar system to the inner solar system, close to the Sun. Early in Earth’s history, comets may have brought water and
other substances to Earth during collisions.
Comet tails form as the comet ﬂies close to the Sun and the outer layers of ice melt and form a glowing coma.
Particles streaming from the Sun push this gas and dust into a long tail. The tail always points away from the Sun.
The coma is bright because it reﬂects light from the Sun ( Figure 13.37). Comets appear for only a short time when
they are near the Sun. They seem to disappear as they move back to the outer solar system.

Chapter 13. The Solar System

FIGURE 13.37
Comet Hale-Bopp, also called the Great Comet of 1997. The comet has
two visible tails: a bright, curved dust tail and a fainter, straight tail of ions
(charged atoms) pointing directly away from the Sun.

The time between one appearance of a comet and the next is called the comet’s period. Halley’s comet, with a period
of 75 years, will next be seen in 2061. The ﬁrst mention of the comet in historical records may go back as much as
two millennia.

Where Comets Come From

Short-period comets have periods of about 200 years or less. These comets come from a region beyond the orbit
of Neptune called the Kuiper belt (pronounced “KI-per”). The Kuiper belt also contains asteroids and at least two
dwarf planets.
Comets with periods as long as thousands or even millions of years come from a very distant region of the solar
system. This region is called the Oort cloud. It is about 50,000-100,000 AU from the Sun (50,000–100,000 times
the distance from the Sun to Earth).

Summary

• Comets are icy objects that have very elliptical orbits around the Sun.
• Comet tails form as ice vaporizes and glows in the Sun’s light.
• Short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune, and long-period comets come from the Oort

cloud far out away from the Sun.

13.18 Meteors

• Deﬁne and describe meteors, meteoroids, and meteorites.
• Explain what makes a meteor shower.

Is this a comet?
When a meteor shoots through the atmosphere, it burns and glows. When we look up and see one, we call it a
shooting star. In this image, the meteor looks like a comet. No need to go anywhere to see this. Just try to catch one
of these meteor showers: the Perseids in mid-August or the Geminids in mid-December. Look for information on
the dates and whether the Moon will not be lighting up the sky.

Meteors

If you look at the sky on a dark night, you may see a meteor ( Figure 13.38). A meteor forms a streak of light across
the sky. People call them shooting stars because that’s what they look like. But meteors are not stars at all. The light
you see comes from a small piece of matter burning up as it ﬂies through Earth’s atmosphere.

Meteoroids

Before these small pieces of matter enter Earth’s atmosphere, they are called meteoroids. Meteoroids are as large as
boulders or as small as tiny sand grains. Larger objects are called asteroids; smaller objects are interplanetary dust.
Meteoroids sometimes cluster together in long trails. They are the debris left behind by comets. When Earth passes
through a comet trail, there is a meteor shower. During a meteor shower, there are many more meteors than normal
for a night or two.

Meteorites

A meteoroid is dragged toward Earth by gravity and enters the atmosphere. Friction with the atmosphere heats the
object quickly, so it starts to vaporize. As it ﬂies through the atmosphere, it leaves a trail of glowing gases. The object
is now a meteor. Most meteors vaporize in the atmosphere. They never reach Earth’s surface. Large meteoroids may
not burn up entirely in the atmosphere. A small core may remain and hit Earth’s surface. This is called a meteorite.
Meteorites provide clues about our solar system. Many were formed in the early solar system ( Figure 13.39). Some
are from asteroids that have split apart. A few are rocks from nearby bodies like Mars. For this to happen, an asteroid
smashed into Mars and sent up debris. A bit of the debris entered Earth’s atmosphere as a meteor.

FIGURE 13.39
The Mars Rover, Opportunity, found a metal meteorite on the Red Planet.

Summary

• A meteor that strikes Earth’s surface is a meteorite.
• Many meteorites are remnants of the earliest material that formed in the solar system.
• Shooting stars are meteors that burn up in Earth’s atmosphere.

13.19 Dwarf Planets

• Describe the characteristics of dwarf planets.
• Compare and contrast planets and dwarf planets.

What is, and what is not, a planet?
Pluto just didn’t ﬁt the criteria for a planet, so it was placed in a new category with others of its kind, dwarf planets.
So what is a planet, and what is Pluto?

What is a Planet?

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union decided that there were too many questions surrounding what could
be called a planet, and so reﬁned the deﬁnition of a planet.
According to the new deﬁnition, a planet must:

• Orbit a star.
• Be big enough that its own gravity causes it to be shaped as a sphere.
• Be small enough that it isn’t a star itself.
• Have cleared the area of its orbit of smaller objects.

1042

www.ck12.org

Dwarf Planets

Chapter 13. The Solar System

The dwarf planets of our solar system are exciting proof of how much we are learning about our solar system. With
the discovery of many new objects in our solar system, astronomers reﬁned the deﬁnition of a dwarf planet in 2006.
According to the IAU, a dwarf planet must:

• Orbit a star.
• Have enough mass to be nearly spherical.
• Not have cleared the area around its orbit of smaller objects.
• Not be a moon.

So dwarf planets are like planets except for one thing. They have not cleared their orbits of smaller objects. They
do not have enough gravity to do this. There are ﬁve recognized dwarf planets in the solar system: Ceres, Pluto,
Makemake, Haumea, and Eris.

Pluto

The reclassiﬁcation of Pluto to the new category dwarf planet stirred up a great deal of controversy. How the
classiﬁcation of Pluto has evolved is an interesting story in science.
From the time it was discovered in 1930 until the early 2000s, Pluto was considered the ninth planet. When
astronomers ﬁrst located Pluto, the telescopes were not as good. Pluto and its moon, Charon, were seen as one
much larger object ( Figure 13.40). With better telescopes, astronomers realized that Pluto was much smaller than
they had thought.

FIGURE 13.40
Pluto and its moon, Charon, are actually two objects.

Better technology also allowed astronomers to discover many smaller objects like Pluto that orbit the Sun. One of
them, Eris, discovered in 2005, is even larger than Pluto.
Pluto was different in other ways. The outer planets are all gas giants. Pluto is small, icy, and rocky. Pluto has a
diameter of about 2,400 km. It has only about one-ﬁfth the mass of Earth’s Moon. Pluto’s orbit is tilted relative to the
other planets. It’s orbit is shaped like a long, narrow ellipse. Pluto’s orbit sometimes even passes inside Neptune’s
orbit.
Pluto’s orbit is in the Kuiper belt. With more than 200 million Kuiper belt objects, Pluto has failed the test of clearing
other bodies out of its orbit.
From what you’ve read above, do you think Pluto should be called a planet? Why are people hesitant to take away
Pluto’s planetary status? Is Pluto a dwarf planet?
A video showing why Pluto isn’t a planet any more: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqX2YdnwtRc .

1043

13.19. Dwarf Planets

www.ck12.org

Pluto has three moons of its own. The largest, Charon, is big compared to Pluto. The Pluto-Charon system is
sometimes called a double dwarf planet ( Figure 13.40). Two smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, were discovered in
2005.
Pluto and the other dwarf planets, besides Ceres, are found orbiting out beyond Neptune.

Ceres

Ceres ( Figure 13.41) is a rocky body that orbits the Sun. It could be an asteroid or a planet. Before 2006, Ceres
was thought to be the largest asteroid. Is it an asteroid? Ceres is in the asteroid belt. But it is by far the largest object
in the belt. Ceres has such high gravity that it is spherical.
Is Ceres a planet? Ceres only has about 1.3% of the mass of the Earth’s Moon. Its orbit is full of other smaller
bodies. Its gravity was not high enough to clear its orbit. Ceres fails the fourth criterion for being a planet. Ceres is
now considered a dwarf planet, the closest to the Sun.

FIGURE 13.41
Ceres is a large spherical object in the asteroid belt.

Haumea

Haumea was named a dwarf planet in 2008. It is an unusual dwarf planet. The body is shaped like an oval! Haumea’s
longest axis is about the same as Pluto’s diameter. Its shortest axis is about half as long. The body’s orbit is tilted 28
degrees. Haumea is so far from the Sun that it takes 283 years to make one orbit ( Figure 13.42).

FIGURE 13.42
An artist’s drawing of what Haumea and its moons might look like. The
moons are drawn closer to Haumea than their actual orbits.

Haumea is the third-brightest Kuiper belt object. Haumea has two moons. Haumea’s odd oval shape is probably
caused by its extremely rapid rotation. It rotates in just less than 4 hours! Like other Kuiper belt objects, Haumea is
covered by ice. Its density is similar to Earth’s Moon, at 2.6 –3.3 g/cm3. This means that most of Haumea is rocky.
Haumea is part of a collisional family. This is a group of astronomical objects that formed from an impact. This
family has Haumea, its two moons, and ﬁve more objects. All of these objects are thought to have formed from a
collision very early in the formation of the solar system.

Makemake

Chapter 13. The Solar System

Makemake is the third-largest and second-brightest dwarf planet we have discovered so far ( Figure 13.43). Make-
make is only 75 percent the size of Pluto. Its diameter is between 1300 and 1900 kilometers. The name comes from
the mythology of the Eastern Islanders. Makemake was the god that created humanity. At a distance between 38.5
to 53 AU, this dwarf planet orbits the Sun in 310 years. Makemake is made of methane, ethane, and nitrogen ices.

FIGURE 13.43
Makemake is a dwarf planet.

Eris

FIGURE 13.44
Eris is the largest known dwarf planet, but it’s so far from the Sun that it
wasn’t discovered until 2005.

Eris is the largest known dwarf planet in the solar system. It is 27 percent larger than Pluto ( Figure 13.44). Like
Pluto and Makemake, Eris is in the Kuiper belt. But Eris is about three times farther from the Sun than Pluto.
Because of its distance, Eris was not discovered until 2005. Early on, it was thought that Eris might be the tenth
planet. Its discovery helped astronomers realize that they needed a new deﬁnition of “planet.” Eris has a small moon
that orbits Eris once about every 16 days.
Astronomers know there may be other dwarf planets far out in the solar system. Look for Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus
to possibly be added to the list of dwarf planets in the future. We still have a lot to discover and explore!

Summary

• There are currently ﬁve dwarf planets in our solar system: Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres.
• Most dwarf planets are similar to planets, except that they haven’t cleared their space of debris.
• Pluto was thought to be larger than it is because its large moon made the dwarf planet look bigger than it is.

Summary

At the center of the solar system is our star, the Sun. The Sun gets its power from the fusion of hydrogen and helium.
The Sun has no solid parts, but it has layers. Much of what the Sun is made of is plasma. The Sun’s surface features,
like sunspots, can affect Earth. Eight planets orbit the Sun. The four nearest the Sun are small, dense, and rocky.
The four farthest from the Sun are large and gaseous. Mercury is the smallest planet. It is closest to the Sun so it
is extremely hot. Venus has a thick, atmosphere with a lot of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide gives the planet
a large greenhouse effect so it is very hot. Earth, the third rock from the Sun, is the only one of the inner planets
with a large moon. The Moon is the only body in the Universe, besides Earth, where humans have walked. The red
planet, Mars, is the most Earth-like. The planet has volcanoes, channels where water once ﬂowed and an enormous
canyon. The four gas planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are made of hydrogen, helium, and
some methane and other gases. All have rings and moons. The solar system also includes at least ﬁve dwarf planets.
After decades as a planet, Pluto was recently made a dwarf planet. There are also asteroids, and comets. An object
that strikes Earth is a meteorite. Increasing numbers of planets are now being found in other solar systems.

To inﬁnity and beyond!
The same tools that are used to study the solar system can be used to study the great beyond. Tools like the Hubble
Space Telescope show astronomers the most amazing things. Even one century ago, no one knew that there was
anything out there beyond our galaxy. Now we can see fantastic images of other galaxies. And supernovae and stars
and even evidence of black holes. In this concept, we will explore a tiny bit of what is out there... beyond our solar
system... even beyond our galaxy! This Hubble Space Telescope image is of one of the Universe’s most photogenic
galaxies, Messier 104.

14.1 Star Constellations

• Deﬁne constellation.
• Explain the difference between apparent and real distances.

Is this pattern of stars meaningful?
This is a constellation, a pattern of stars in the night sky. This constellation is called Orion. The features you can see
best are his belt and sword. You can see Orion’s belt in the sky from many locations. These stars are very bright.
For many constellations, the stars are not near each other. They just happen to appear near each other in our sky.

Stars

When you look at the sky on a clear night, you can see hundreds of stars. A star is a giant ball of glowing gas that is
very, very hot. A star generates energy by nuclear fusion reactions. Most of these stars are like our Sun. However,
some stars are smaller than our Sun, and some are larger. Except for our own Sun, all stars are so far away that they
only look like single points—even through a telescope.

Constellations

The stars that make up a constellation appear close to each other from Earth. In reality, they may be very distant
from one another. Constellations were important to people, like the Ancient Greeks. People who spent a lot of time
outdoors at night, like shepherds, named the constellations. They told stories about them. Pictured below is one of
the most easily recognized constellations ( Figure 14.1). The ancient Greeks thought this group of stars looked like
a hunter. They named it Orion, after a great hunter in Greek mythology.
The constellations stay the same night after night. The patterns of the stars never change. However, each night the
constellations move across the sky. They move because Earth is spinning on its axis. The constellations also move

FIGURE 14.1
Orion has three stars that make up his
belt. Orion’s belt is fairly easy to see in
the night sky.

with the seasons. This is because Earth revolves around the Sun. The constellations in the winter are different from
those in the summer. For example, Orion is high up in the winter sky. In the summer, it’s only up in the early
morning.
Constellations are useful. They help astronomers and other observers orient in the night sky. The star Betelgeuse,
for example, is Orion’s right shoulder. Betelgeuse is the eighth brightest star in the sky. The star is an excellent
example of a red supergiant.

Apparent Versus Real Distances

The stars in a constellation appear close together in our night sky. But they are not at all close together out in space.
In the constellation Orion, the stars visible to the naked eye are at distances ranging from just 26 light-years (which
is relatively close to Earth) to several thousand light-years away.

What is Astrology?

Ancient Babylonian astronomers created the Zodiac. The Zodiac is a circle that divides the ecliptic into twelve
30-degree zones. Each zone contains a constellation, many of them animals. Horoscopes based on these astrological
signs ﬁrst appeared in Ptolemaic Egypt in around 50 BC. These early people used astrology to explain things that
are now much better explained by science. You can see an example of a Zodiac below ( Figure 14.2).

1052

www.ck12.org

Chapter 14. Beyond the Solar System

FIGURE 14.2
How did astrology come to be?

There is no reason to think that the alignment of the stars has anything to do with events that happen on Earth. The
constellations are patterns made from stars in the sky. The patterns do not reﬂect any characteristics of the stars
themselves. When scientiﬁc tests are done to provide evidence in support of astrological ideas, the tests fail. When
a scientiﬁc idea fails, it is abandoned or modiﬁed. Astrologers do not change or abandon their ideas when they fail.
So astrology is not science.

Summary

• The points of light in the night sky are stars that are balls of gas. They are lit by nuclear fusion.
• Constellations are patterns of stars seen from Earth. These stars are usually not near each other.
• Stars in a constellation may be fairly close together. More likely, though, they are extremely far apart.

14.2 Star Power

• Describe nuclear fusion.
• Explain how nuclear fusion causes stars to shine.

Did you know that the night sky is so bright?
Starlight can be surprisingly bright in the night sky. Of course, daytime is all about starlight. The star is our Sun,
and it shines so brightly because it is so close to us. Even the Moon is bright because of light from the Sun. Some
stars produce much more energy than the Sun. They’re just farther away, so the light is not as obvious. How do stars
generate so much energy?

Nuclear Fusion

Stars shine because of nuclear fusion. Fusion reactions in the Sun’s core keep our nearest star burning. Stars are
made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Both are very light gases, but a star contains so much hydrogen and helium

1055

14.2. Star Power

www.ck12.org

that its total mass is enormous. The pressure at the center of a star is great enough to heat the gases. This causes
nuclear fusion reactions.
A nuclear fusion reaction is so named because the nuclei (center) of atoms fuse (join) together in the process. In
stars like our Sun, hydrogen atoms join together to create a helium atom. Nuclear fusion reactions need a lot of
energy to get started. Once they begin, they produce even more energy. ( Figure 14.3).

FIGURE 14.3
A thermonuclear bomb is an uncontrolled fusion reaction in which enor-
mous amounts of energy are released.

Particle Accelerators

Scientists have built machines called particle accelerators. These amazing tools smash particles that are smaller
than atoms into each other head-on. This creates new particles. Scientists use particle accelerators to learn about
nuclear fusion in stars. They can also learn about how atoms came together in the ﬁrst few minutes of the Universe.
Two well-known accelerators are SLAC, in California, and CERN, in Switzerland ( Figure 14.4).

FIGURE 14.4
The SLAC National Accelerator Lab in California can propel particles a straight 2 mi (3.2 km).

Summary

• In a nuclear fusion reaction, nuclei combine to form a larger nucleus.
• The energy from fusion reactions keeps the star shining.
• Particle accelerators simulate nuclear fusion in stars.

14.3. Star Classiﬁcation

www.ck12.org

14.3 Star Classiﬁcation

• Describe how scientists classify stars.
• Explain the relationship between the color of a star and its temperature.

Why are the stars in the Orion constellation different colors?
In this view of Orion you can see that the stars are different colors. The red star in the upper left is Betelgeuse
(pronounced BET-ul-juice). The blue star in the lower right is Rigel. The fuzzy patch in the sword is the Orion
nebula. The nebula will be discussed in the concept "Star Formation."

Star Classiﬁcation

With a quick look, stars look the same. Look closer, though, and you can see differences. The most obvious
differences are in size and color.

1058

www.ck12.org

Color and Temperature

Chapter 14. Beyond the Solar System

Think about the coil of an electric stove as it heats up. The coil changes in color as its temperature rises. When you
ﬁrst turn on the heat, the coil looks black. The air a few inches above the coil begins to feel warm. As the coil gets
hotter, it starts to glow a dull red. As it gets even hotter, it becomes a brighter red. Next it turns orange. If it gets
extremely hot, it might look yellow-white, or even blue-white. Like a coil on a stove, a star’s color is determined by
the temperature of the star’s surface. Relatively cool stars are red. Warmer stars are orange or yellow. Extremely hot
stars are blue or blue-white.
Star temperatures are measured in degrees kelvin. The lowest temperature on the kelvin scale is absolute zero. That
means molecules have no motion. Kelvin is related to Celsius and Fahrenheit in these ways:
[°C] = [K] − 273.15
[°F] = [K] × 9/5 − 459.67

Classiﬁcation

A graph of the brightness (absolute magnitude) of stars versus their color (temperature) is pictured below ( Figure
14.5). This is called Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

FIGURE 14.5
The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram plots
luminosity (absolute magnitude) against
the color of the stars ranging from the
high-temperature blue-white stars on the
left side of the diagram to the low temper-
ature red stars on the right side.

Most stars fall along the main sequence curve. Stars in the main sequence fuse hydrogen into helium in the core.
The horizontal branch also has many stars. These fuse helium in the core and burn hydrogen surrounding the core.
Other stars are found in other regions.

Object Size

This illustration ( Figure 14.6) shows the relative sizes of stars and their mass compared to the Sun. Red dwarfs
are less massive and much smaller in size than the Sun. This means they have a very long lifetime. Our Sun is a
fairly common type of star and has an average lifespan. Red giants are what some main sequence stars (like our
Sun) become near the end of their lives. They are much larger than our Sun. Supergiants are very massive stars and
are larger than our Sun, but have a smaller radius than red giants. Supergiants have very short lifetimes.

hottest.

14.4. Star Formation

www.ck12.org

14.4 Star Formation

• Describe star formation.

Can you see stars being born?
On a dark night you can practically watch stars being born. The fuzzy area in the sword in the constellation Orion is
the Orion nebula. A close up shows the nebula with around 3,000 stars. New stars are being born there.

Star Lives

Stars have a life cycle, just like people. Stars are born, grow, change over time, and eventually grow old and die.
Most stars change in size, color, and class at least once in their lifetime. What astronomers know about the life
cycles of stars comes from data gathered from visual, radio, and X-ray telescopes.

Nebulae

Stars are born in a cloud of gas and dust called a nebula ( Figure 14.7). Our Sun and solar system formed out of a
nebula.
The Pillars of Creation ( Figure 14.8) are within the Eagle Nebula. The pillars are thought to be a large region where
stars are forming. The dark areas may be stars that are about to begin.

Star Formation

For a star to form, gravity pulls gas and dust into the center of the nebula. As the material becomes denser, the
pressure and the temperature increase. When the temperature of the center becomes hot enough, nuclear fusion
begins. The ball of gas has become a star!

14.5 Main Sequence Star Lives

• Describe the main stages in the life cycle of stars.
• Explain the relationship between a star’s life cycle and its size.

What do most stars look like?
We have a main sequence star nearby. Our Sun is on the main sequence, classiﬁed as a yellow dwarf. Our Sun has
been a main sequence star for about 5 billion years. As a medium-sized star, it will continue to shine for about 5
billion more years. Most stars are on the main sequence.

Main Sequence Stars

For most of a star’s life, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium atoms. A star like this is a main sequence star. The
hotter a main sequence star is, the brighter it is. A star remains on the main sequence as long as it is fusing hydrogen
to form helium.

Classifying Stars by Color

www.ck12.org

The most common way of classifying main sequence stars is by color ( Table 14.1). Each class of star is given a
letter, a color, and a range of temperatures. The letters don’t match the color names because stars were ﬁrst grouped
as A through O. It wasn’t until later that their order was corrected to go by increasing temperature. When you try to
remember the order, you can use this phrase: “Oh Be A Fine Good Kid, Man.”

Sample Star

There are two types of
Class M stars: red dwarfs
and red giants.

An artist’s depiction of a
red dwarf star. Most stars
are red dwarfs.

The red supergiant Betel-
geuse is seen near Orion’s
belt. The blue star in the
lower right is the Class B
star Rigel.

The surface temperature of most stars is due to their size. Bigger stars produce more energy, so their surfaces are
hotter. But some very small stars are very hot. Some very big stars are cool.
Large stars burn through their supply of hydrogen very quickly. These stars “live fast and die young!” A very large
star may only be on the main sequence for 10 million years. A very small star could remain on the main sequence
for tens to hundreds of billions of years—far longer than the current age of our Universe.

Summary

• Stars spend most of their lives on the main sequence. These stars fuse hydrogen into helium for energy.
• Large main sequence stars may be hotter than small stars—but not always.
• Large stars are not on the main sequence as long as small stars.

14.6 Red Giants and White Dwarfs

• Describe a red giant star and a white dwarf star.
• Know when a star becomes a red giant or a white dwarf.

What’s next for the Sun?
What happens after our Sun comes off the main sequence? Our Sun will become an enormous red star. It will grow
so large that it will be out past Mars to the edge of the asteroid belt. Obviously, it will engulf our Earth. Betelgeuse
is a red giant star that you can see in the sky near Orion.

Red Giants

Eventually a main sequence star will use up all of its hydrogen.
It then starts to fuse helium atoms into larger
elements like carbon. At this time, the star’s core will collapse inward. The star’s outer layers will spread out and
cool. The result is a larger star that is cooler on the surface, and red in color. The star is now a red giant.

White Dwarfs

Eventually a red giant burns up all of the helium in its core. What happens next depends on the star’s mass. A star
like the Sun stops fusion and shrinks into a white dwarf star. A white dwarf is a hot, white, glowing object about
the size of Earth. Eventually, a white dwarf cools down, and its light fades out.
Sirius ( Figure 14.9) is seen as the brightest star in the sky. It is actually a binary star system. Sirius A is on the
main sequence. Sirius B is a tiny white dwarf.

Summary

• When stars fuse helium into larger atoms, they become red giants.
• In a red giant, the inner helium core contracts while the outer layers of hydrogen expand.
• When the helium is gone, the stars become white dwarfs.

14.7 Supergiants and Supernovas

• Describe how a star becomes a supergiant.
• Explain the importance of supernovas.

What if the sun were larger?
A larger star has a different fate. It will not just eventually fade away. A large star will explode. These explosions
are very important for all of us. We could not exist without them. To see the results of supernova explosions, you
need only look at yourself.

Supergiants

A more massive star ends its life in a more dramatic way. Very massive stars become red supergiants. Unlike a red
giant, when all the helium in a red supergiant is gone, fusion continues. Lighter atoms fuse into heavier atoms up to
iron atoms. Creating elements heavier than iron through fusion uses more energy than it produces. For this reason,
stars do not ordinarily form any heavier elements. When there are no more elements for the star to fuse, the core
succumbs to gravity and collapses.
Betelgeuse ( Figure 14.10) is a red supergiant. VY Canis Majoris, the largest known star, is even larger.
classiﬁed as a red hypergiant.
In a red supergiant, fusion does not stop. Lighter atoms fuse into heavier atoms. Eventually iron atoms form.

Supernova

When there is nothing left to fuse, the star’s iron core explodes violently. This is called a supernova explosion. The
incredible energy released fuses heavy atoms together. The elements heavier than iron form in supernova explosions,
including gold, silver, and uranium. A supernova can shine as brightly as an entire galaxy, but only for a short time,
as illustrated below ( Figure 14.11).

FIGURE 14.11

(b) This false-color
image of the supernova remnant SN 1604
was observed as a supernova in the Milky
Way galaxy. At its peak, it was brighter
than all other stars and planets, except
Venus, in the night sky.

The Importance of Supernovae

All chemical elements except hydrogen, helium, and lithium were created in stars. These chemical elements are
found in our solar system and on Earth because of supernova explosions. This is what people mean when they say
that we are all made of stardust.

Summary

• When a massive star has no more elements left to fuse, it explodes as a supernova.
• Chemical elements heavier than lithium form in a supernova.
• A supernova explosion spreads the elements into nearby space. This is the source of most of our elements.

14.8 Neutron Stars and Black Holes

• Describe the characteristics of neutron stars.
• Describe the characteristics of black holes.

How dense can you get?
A neutron star has about 500,000 times Earth’s mass. It is the size of Brooklyn, New York. These objects have an
immense amount of gravity, but not as much as a black hole!

Neutron Stars

After a supernova explosion, the star’s core is left over. This material is extremely dense. What happens next
depends on the core’s mass. The core might be less than about four times the mass of the sun. In this case, the star
will become a neutron star. A neutron star ( Figure 14.12) is made almost entirely of neutrons. A neutron star has
more mass than the sun; yet, it is only a few kilometers in diameter.

FIGURE 14.12

A pulsar is a rotating neutron star that emits radiation in pulses. A pulsar can only be seen when the beam is pointing

toward Earth. Pictured below is a nebular that looks like a cosmic hand ( Figure 14.13). There is a bright swirl of
gas in the wrist of the hand. A very tiny but bright neutron star is in the center of that swirl.

FIGURE 14.13
A neutron star at the center of a nebula.

A pulsar sits in the center of this nebula.

Black Holes

The core remaining after a supernova could be more than about ﬁve times the mass of the sun. In this case, the core
collapses to become a black hole. Black holes are unimaginably dense. Not even light can escape their gravity (
Figure 14.14)! This is why they are black. We can’t see black holes.
How can we know something exists if radiation can’t escape it? A black hole affects the objects around it. It affects
them with its gravity. Some radiation may leak out around the edges of a black hole. A black hole isn’t a hole at all.
It is the tremendously dense core of a supermassive star.

FIGURE 14.14
The light of these galaxies is being bent by a black hole.

Summary

• After a supernova explosion, the star’s core is left.
• If the core is less dense, it becomes a neutron star. A neutron star is made almost all of neutrons.
• If the core is more dense, it becomes a black hole. No light can escape a black hole.

14.9 Star Clusters

• Deﬁne star system.
• Know the two main types of star clusters.

Can you see a star cluster in the night sky?
The Pleiades are also called the seven sisters. Seven of the stars in this cluster are visible in the night sky with the
naked eye. The Pleiades are easy to spot. They are bright and very close to each other.

Star Systems

Our solar system has only one star. But many stars are in star systems of two or more stars. Two stars that orbit
each other are called a binary star system. If more than two stars orbit each other, it is called a multiple star system.
Pictured below are two binary star systems orbiting each other ( Figure 14.15). This creates an unusual quadruple
star system. The distance separating the two pairs is about the same as the distance from our Sun to Pluto.

Star Clusters

Star clusters are small groups of stars. A star cluster is smaller than a galaxy. There are two main types, open
clusters and globular clusters. Both types are held together by gravity.

Open Clusters

Open clusters are groups of up to a few thousand stars. The Jewel Box ( Figure 14.16), is an open cluster. Open
clusters tend to be blue in color. They often contain glowing gas and dust. The stars in an open cluster are young

stars that all formed from the same nebula.

These hot blue stars are in an open cluster known as the Jewel Box. The
red star is a young red supergiant.

Globular Clusters

Globular clusters ( Figure 14.17) are groups of tens to hundreds of thousands of stars. Gravity holds these stars
tightly together. Globular clusters have a deﬁnite, spherical shape. They contain mostly old, reddish stars. Near
the center of a globular cluster, the stars are closer together. The heart of the globular cluster M13 has hundreds of
thousands of stars. M13 is 145 light years in diameter. The cluster contains red and blue giant stars.

14.10 Galaxies

• Describe the types of galaxies.

What’s happening with those galaxies?
Find a clear night sky and get out a good pair of binoculars or a telescope. You can see this feature (although not
quite as well). The Whirlpool galaxy has an enhanced spiral structure due to its interactions with its companion
galaxy, NGC 5195.

Galaxies

Compared to Earth, the solar system is a big place. Compared to the solar system a star cluster is a big place. But
galaxies are bigger—a lot bigger.
A galaxy is a very large group of stars held together by gravity. How enormous a galaxy is and how many stars it
contains is impossible for us to really understand. A galaxy contains up to a few billion stars! Our solar system is
in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is so large that if our solar system were the size of your ﬁst, the galaxy’s disk would be
wider than the entire United States! There are several different types of galaxies, and there are billions of galaxies
in the Universe.

Types of Galaxies

Galaxies are divided into three types, according to shape. There are spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and irregular
galaxies.

1081

14.10. Galaxies

Spiral Galaxies

www.ck12.org

A spiral galaxy is a rotating disk of stars and dust. In the center is a dense bulge of material. Several spiral arms
come out from the center. Spiral galaxies have lots of gas and dust and many young stars. The image below ( Figure
14.18) shows a spiral galaxy from the side. You can see the disk and central bulge.

FIGURE 14.18
The Pinwheel Galaxy is a spiral galaxy displaying prominent arms.

The closest spiral galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy ( Figure 14.19) is 2,500,000 light years away and contains one
trillion stars!

FIGURE 14.19
The Andromeda Galaxy is the closest major galaxy to our own.

Elliptical Galaxies

Pictured below is a typical elliptical galaxy ( Figure 14.20). As you might have guessed, elliptical galaxies are
elliptical, or egg-shaped. The smallest elliptical galaxies are as small as some globular clusters. Giant elliptical
galaxies can contain over a trillion stars. Elliptical galaxies are reddish to yellowish in color because they contain
mostly old stars.

Irregular Galaxies and Dwarf Galaxies

Look at the galaxy pictured below ( Figure 14.21). Do you think this is a spiral galaxy or an elliptical galaxy? It
is neither one! Galaxies that are not clearly elliptical galaxies or spiral galaxies are called irregular galaxies. Most
irregular galaxies were once spiral or elliptical galaxies. They were then deformed either by gravitational attraction
to a larger galaxy or by a collision with another galaxy.

Dwarf galaxies are small galaxies containing “only” a few million to a few billion stars. Most dwarf galaxies are
irregular in shape. However, there are also dwarf elliptical galaxies and dwarf spiral galaxies. Dwarf galaxies are
the most common type in the Universe. However, because they are relatively small and dim, we don’t see as many
dwarf galaxies as we do their full-sized cousins.

Summary

• A galaxy is composed of millions to billions of stars.
• Galaxies can be spiral, elliptical, or irregular.
• Dwarf galaxies are smaller. Any of the three types can be dwarf galaxies.

14.11 Milky Way

• Describe the characteristics of the Milky Way Galaxy.

Have you seen the Milky Way?
There is so much light pollution in most cities that many people have never seen the Milky Way. On a clear night
away from lights, the view is of a bright white river of stars. You don’t need a telescope or even binoculars to see it.
The view of the Milky Way is so bright because you’re looking at the stars in your own galaxy.

The Milky Way Galaxy

The Milky Way Galaxy is our galaxy. Home, sweet home. The Milky Way is made of millions of stars along with
a lot of gas and dust. It looks different from other galaxies because we are looking at the main disk from within the
galaxy. Astronomers estimate that the Milky Way contains 200 billion to 400 billion stars.

Shape and Size

It is difﬁcult to know what the shape of the Milky Way Galaxy is because we are inside of it. Astronomers have
identiﬁed it as a typical spiral galaxy containing about 100 billion to 400 billion stars ( Figure 14.22).
Like other spiral galaxies, our galaxy has a disk, a central bulge, and spiral arms. The disk is about 100,000 light-
years across and 3,000 light-years thick. Most of the Galaxy’s gas, dust, young stars, and open clusters are in the
disk.
The Milky Way Galaxy is a big place. If our solar system were the size of your ﬁst, the Galaxy’s disk would still be
wider than the entire United States!

Where We Are

Our solar system, including the Sun, Earth, and all the other planets, is within one of the spiral arms in the disk of the
Milky Way Galaxy. Most of the stars we see in the sky are also in this spiral arm. We are about 26,000 light-years
from the center of the galaxy. We are a little more than halfway out from the center of the galaxy to the edge.
Just as Earth orbits the Sun, the solar system orbits the center of the galaxy. Astronomers have recently discovered
that at the center of the Milky Way and most other galaxies, is a supermassive black hole.
This video describes the solar system in which we live. It is located in an outer edge of the Milky Way galaxy, which
spans 100,000 light years: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rt7FevNiRc (5:10).

Human Understanding of the Universe

What did the ancient Greeks recognize as the Universe? Their Universe had Earth at the center, the Sun, the Moon,
ﬁve planets, and a sphere to which all the stars were attached. This idea held for many centuries. Galileo and his
telescope helped people recognize that Earth is not the center of the Universe. They also found out that there are
many more stars than were visible to the naked eye. All of those stars were in the Milky Way Galaxy.
In the early 20th century, an astronomer named Edwin Hubble ( Figure 14.23) discovered something amazing. He
showed that the Andromeda Nebula was over 2 million light years away. This was many times farther than the
farthest distances that had ever been measured. Hubble realized that many of the objects that astronomers called
nebulas were not actually clouds of gas. They were collections of millions or billions of stars. We now call these
features galaxies.

FIGURE 14.23

ﬂecting telescope at
the Mount Wilson
Observatory in California to show that
some distant specks of light were galax-
ies.
(b) Hubble’s namesake space tele-
scope spotted this six galaxy group. Ed-
win Hubble demonstrated the existence of
galaxies.

Hubble showed that the Universe was much larger than our own galaxy. Today, we know that the Universe contains
about a hundred billion galaxies. This is about the same number of galaxies as there are stars in the Milky Way
Galaxy.

Summary

• The Universe contains about a hundred billion galaxies.
• The idea of a Universe has changed through human history.

14.13 Expansion of the Universe

• Explain how astronomers use redshift to determine that the Universe is expanding.

Why does a siren change pitch as it passes you?
The sound of a siren on an emergency vehicle changes as it passes you. It shifts from higher to lower pitch. As
the vehicle moves toward you, the sound waves are pushed together. As the vehicle moves past you, the waves are
spread apart. This effect with light tells astronomers something about our Universe.

The Universe is Expanding

After discovering that there are galaxies outside our own, Edwin Hubble went on to measure the distance to hundreds
of other galaxies. His data would eventually show us how the Universe is changing, and even give us clues as to how
the Universe formed.

Redshift

If you look at a star through a prism, you will see a spectrum. The spectrum is the range of colors seen in a
rainbow. The spectrum has speciﬁc dark bands where elements in the star have absorbed light of certain energies.
An astronomer can use these lines to determine which elements are in a distant star. In fact, the element helium was
ﬁrst discovered in our Sun, not on Earth. This was done by analyzing the absorption lines in the spectrum of the sun.
Astronomers studied the spectra of light from distant galaxies. When they did this they noticed something strange.
The dark lines in the spectrum were in the patterns they expected. But they were shifted toward the red end of the
spectrum ( Figure 14.24). This shift of absorption bands toward the red end of the spectrum is known as redshift.

FIGURE 14.24
Redshift is a shift in absorption bands
toward the red end of the spectrum. Red-
shift occurs when the light source is mov-
ing away from you or when the space
between you and the source is stretched.

Redshift occurs when the source of light is moving away from the observer. So when astronomers see redshift in
the light from a galaxy, they know that the galaxy is moving away from Earth. The strange part is that almost every
galaxy in the Universe has a redshift. Of course, this means that almost every galaxy is moving away from us.

The Expanding Universe

Edwin Hubble combined his measurements of the distances to galaxies with other astronomers’ measurements of
redshift. He noticed a relationship, which is now called Hubble’s Law: The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is
moving away from us. In other words, the Universe is expanding!
Pictured below is a simpliﬁed diagram of the expansion of the Universe ( Figure 14.25). Another way to picture
this is to imagine a balloon covered with tiny dots. Each dot represents a galaxy. When you inﬂate the balloon, the
dots slowly move away from each other because the rubber stretches in the space between them. If it were a giant
balloon and you were standing on one of the dots, you would see the other dots moving away from you. Not only
that, but dots farther away from you on the balloon would move away faster than dots nearby.

FIGURE 14.25
This is a simpliﬁed diagram of the expansion of the Universe over time.
Note that the distance between galaxies gets bigger as you go forward in
time, but the size of each galaxy stays about the same.

An inﬂating balloon is not exactly like the expanding Universe. The surface of a balloon has only two dimensions,
while space has three dimensions. But it is true that space itself is stretching out between galaxies like the rubber
stretches when a balloon is inﬂated. This stretching of space, which causes the distance between galaxies to increase,
is what astronomers mean by the expansion of the Universe.
One other difference between the Universe and our balloon model involves the actual size of the galaxies. On the
inﬂating balloon, the dots you made will become larger in size as you inﬂate it. In our Universe, however, the
galaxies stay the same size; it is just the space between the galaxies that increases as the Universe expands.

14.14 Big Bang

• Explain and give evidence supporting the Big Bang theory.
• Describe what occurred after the Big Bang.

How did everything begin in the Big Bang?
The time when the Universe began is the explosion known as the Big Bang. Everything in the Universe was part of
that explosion, although not in its current form.

The Big Bang Theory

There is a great deal of evidence that the Universe started with a big bang. The Big Bang theory is the most widely
accepted cosmological explanation of how the Universe formed. Think about the expanding Universe, then reverse
it. If we start at the present and go back into the past, the Universe gets smaller. What is the end result of a contracting
Universe? A point.
According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe began about 13.7 billion years ago. Everything that is now in the
Universe was squeezed into a point. It was all in a single, hot, chaotic mass. Then an enormous explosion—a big

bang—took place. The big bang caused the Universe to start expanding rapidly. All the matter and energy, even
space itself, came out of this explosion ( Figure 14.26).
What came before the Big Bang? There is no way for scientists to know, since there is no remaining evidence.

After the Big Bang

In the ﬁrst few moments after the Big Bang, the Universe was unimaginably hot and dense. As the Universe
expanded, it became less dense.
It began to cool. After only a few seconds, protons, neutrons, and electrons
could form. After a few minutes, hydrogen came together. There was so much energy that nuclear fusion began.
This created helium.
Clumps of matter were held together by gravity. Eventually, these clumps formed stars. There are now countless
trillions of stars, billions of galaxies, and other structures that form the visible Universe.
The galaxies at the edge of the Universe are a great distance away. But they are something else that is distant.
Because it takes so long for light from so far away to reach us, they are also very far back in time ( Figure 14.27).

Images from very far away show what the Universe was like not too long
after the Big Bang.

Background Radiation

www.ck12.org

The Big Bang hypothesis was not immediately accepted. But an important line of evidence for the Big Bang was
discovered in 1964. In a static Universe, the space between objects should have no heat at all. The temperature
should measure 0 K (Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale). But two researchers at Bell Laboratories used a
microwave receiver to measure the background radiation in the Universe. They discovered that it is not 0 K, but 3 K
( Figure 14.28). This tiny amount of heat is left over from the Big Bang. Nearly all astronomers and cosmologists
now accept the Big Bang theory.

Background radiation in the Universe was
good evidence for the Big Bang theory.

George Smoot, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work
on the origin of the Universe. Using background radiation, detected by the Cosmic Background Explorer Satellite
(COBE), Smoot was able to make a picture of the Universe when it was 12 hours old. Learn more at: http://scien

14.15 Dark Matter

• Describe evidence for the existence of dark matter
• Describe the role dark matter plays in the Universe.
• Describe what is known about dark energy.

Does science know everything?
There are many things that science does not understand yet. There are some things that science may never under-
stand. Science deals with things that are very far away. Or very old. Or that have left few traces of their existence.
Some of the most difﬁcult topics to study are in cosmology. The questions are age-old: What formed the Universe?
What will be the fate of the Universe? These are exciting questions to work on! Dark matter and dark energy are
two topics that are important to them.

Dark Matter

We see many objects out in space that emit light. We see other objects that emit other types of electromagnetic
radiation. The matter we can see is contained in stars. The stars are contained in galaxies. Scientists think that stars
and galaxies make up only a small part of the matter in the Universe. The rest of the matter is called dark matter.

Evidence for Dark Matter

Dark matter doesn’t emit light, so we can’t see it. We know it is there because it affects the motion of objects around
it. For example, astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate. The outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same
speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than we can
see. The way light bends around a very distant supermassive object is also due to dark matter ( Figure 14.29).

Chapter 14. Beyond the Solar System

FIGURE 14.29
The arc around the galaxies at the center
of this image is caused by gravitational
lensing. The addition of gravitational pull
from dark matter is required to explain this
phenomenon.

What is Dark Matter?

What is dark matter? Actually, we don’t really know. Dark matter could just be ordinary matter, like what makes up
Earth. The Universe could contain lots of objects that don’t have enough mass to glow on their own. There might
just be a lot of black holes. Another possibility is that the Universe contains a lot of matter that is different from
anything we know. If it doesn’t interact much with ordinary matter, it would be very difﬁcult or impossible to detect
directly.
Most scientists who study dark matter think it is a combination. Ordinary matter is part of it. That is mixed with
some kind of matter that we haven’t discovered yet. Most scientists think that ordinary matter is less than half of the
total matter in the Universe.

Dark Energy

We know that the Universe is expanding. Astronomers have wondered if it is expanding fast enough to escape the
pull of gravity. Would the Universe just expand forever? If it could not escape the pull of gravity, would it someday
start to contract? This means it would eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch. This is the opposite of the
Big Bang.
Scientists may now have an answer. Recently, astronomers have discovered that the Universe is expanding even
faster than before. What is causing the expansion to accelerate? One hypothesis is that there is energy out in the
Universe that we can’t see. Astronomers call this dark energy. We know even less about dark energy than we know
about dark matter. Some scientists think that dark energy makes up more than half of the Universe.

Summary

• Dark matter emits no electromagnetic radiation. For this reason it cannot be sensed by astronomers.
• Dark matter does have gravity. The effect of its gravity is seen on the motion of nearby objects.
• Dark matter may be ordinary matter that is dark.
It may be different from ordinary matter.

It may be a

combination of the two.

• No one knows if dark energy exists. If it does, there may be a lot of it.

Summary

Chapter 14. Beyond the Solar System

Like humans, stars have a life cycle. Stars are born, go through middle age and then end in some sort of death.
Exactly what happens depends on the size of the star. We can see different types of stars in the sky. Some stars
are brighter than others. Some are colored and some are white. Stars are classiﬁed by their size and brightness.
Stars cluster in galaxies. There are some fantastic galaxies to see! We are located on an arm of a spiral galaxy.
Our galaxy is called the Milky Way. There are many other galaxies of different types. Scientists use observations,
measurements, and mathematical calculations to hypothesize an origin for the Universe. The theory that ﬁts the data
is called the Big Bang. Scientists continue to learn new things about the Universe. For example, dark matter and
dark energy have only recently been discovered. In fact, dark energy may not even exist!
