5.3.2.1.7	Minerals can be changed into different minerals by heat, pressure, or the chemical action of water.
5.3.2.1.8	Minerals are classified according to composition, classes are: silicates, carbonates, sulfides, sulfates, halides, hydroxides, and phosphates.
5.3.2.1.9	Key Vocabulary: crystal, mineral, inorganic
5.3.3.1.1	Part Two: Mineral Identification
5.3.3.1.2	Mineral identification refers to the way to tell one mineral from another.
5.3.3.1.3	The color is the most obvious but one of the least reliable methods of identifying minerals.
5.3.3.4.1	Hardness is a measure of how easily a mineral can be scratched.
5.3.3.4.2	The Mohs hardness scale lists hardness of ten minerals with 1 being softest and 10 the hardest.
5.3.3.4.3	We can determine the approximate hardness of a mineral by running a group of tests.
5.3.3.4.4	Scratch the mineral in question with a fingernail, penny, iron nail, or glass slide.
5.3.3.4.5	If the mineral shows a scratch mark from one of the testing materials, the mineral is said to be less hard than the mineral that scratched it.
5.3.3.4.6	Example: A piece of pink feldspar will not be scratched by a fingernail, penny, or an iron nail, but will be scratched by a glass slide.
5.3.3.4.7	The feldspar is said to be harder than the first three testing materials but not as hard as the glass slide.
5.3.3.5.1	Luster describes how light is reflected from a mineral's surface.
5.3.3.5.2	Luster gives you an indication of how "shiny" a mineral is. The two main ways that geologists categorize a mineral's luster is metallic or non-metallic. 
5.3.3.5.3	Metallic minerals look like metal (they may or may not be shiny), while non-metallic minerals vary greatly in their appearance and are usually described as shiny, pearly, waxy, glassy, etc.
5.3.3.6.1	Streak is the color of the mineral when it is broken up into powder.
5.3.3.6.2	Streak is a test used by a geologist to see the color of the mineral under the top layer or coating on the mineral.
5.3.3.6.3	The mineral is rubbed on a "streak plate", which is a piece of porcelain.
5.3.3.6.4	When the mineral is rubbed across the streak plate some of the mineral is broken off and ground into a powder.
5.3.3.6.5	This allows the geologist to see under the outer layer which could have a different color due to the mineral being exposed to the atmosphere.
5.3.3.6.6	When minerals are exposed to the atmosphere, gasses like oxygen can chemically combine with the mineral to change its outer color.
5.3.3.7.1	Cleavage & Fracture refer to the way the mineral breaks.
5.3.3.7.2	Some minerals have a tendency to split or crack along parallel or flat planes.
5.3.3.7.3	This property is easily seen in some minerals and you can test the mineral by breaking it with a hammer or splitting off sheets with a pen knife.
5.3.3.7.4	These planes along which the mineral breaks are called cleavage planes.
5.3.3.7.5	If the mineral splits easily along these planes the mineral is then said to have perfect cleavage.
5.3.3.7.6	Fracture is related to cleavage.
5.3.3.7.7	Fracture occurs when a mineral breaks at random lines instead of at consistent cleavage planes.
5.3.3.7.8	Many minerals that have no cleavage or poor cleavage fracture easily.
5.3.3.7.9	Key Vocabulary: cleavage, color, fracture, hardness, luster, metallic, non-metallic, streak

5.3.5.1.1	Part Four: Rock Identification and Rock Types
5.3.5.1.2	The solid part of the earth is composed of substances collectively known as rock.
5.3.5.1.3	Most rocks are composed of one or more naturally occurring inorganic crystalline substances called minerals.
5.3.5.1.4	The three main rock classifications are Igneous, Sedimentary, and Metamorphic.
5.3.5.1.5	Rocks are classified into these groups by the way they were formed.
5.3.5.2.1	Igneous rock is molten material from a volcano (lava) or from deep inside the earth (magma) which cools and hardens comes from the Latin word ignis which means "fire" are usually found near volcanoes or divergent boundaries (separating plates) are classified by composition and texture 
5.3.5.2.2	Extrusive Igneous Rock (Volcanic) is formed on Earth's surface when molten rock flows out of the earth (lava) and cools quickly at the surface to form fine crystals.
5.3.5.2.3	Rocks formed in this way have a fine ­ grained texture.
5.3.5.2.4	Examples of extrusive igneous rocks are Pumice, Basalt, and Obsidian.
5.3.5.2.5	Intrusive Igneous Rock (Plutonic) is formed in the Earth when molten rock flows upward into the more solid part of the crust.
5.3.5.2.6	Rocks formed this way have a coarse ­ grained texture.
5.3.5.2.7	Granite is an example of an intrusive igneous rock.
5.3.5.3.1	Sedimentary rock can form from particles of rock, from remains of plants or animals, or from chemical reactions are classified by their composition and by the way they were formed are formed from the cementing together of small pieces of rocks or shells are called sedimentary rocks are usually found near water are found in flat layers or strata.
5.3.5.3.2	Fossils are found in these layers.
5.3.5.3.3	Clastic sedimentary rocks come from fragments of other rocks.
5.3.5.3.4	Examples: Shale, Sandstone.
5.3.5.3.5	Non-clastic organic sedimentary rock comes from the remains of organisms. Examples: coal, limestone.
5.3.5.3.6	Non-clastic chemical sedimentary rock is formed when mineral grains dissolved in water are precipitated or are left behind when a solution evaporates.
5.3.5.3.7	Examples: rock salt, gypsum.
5.3.5.4.1	Metamorphic rock forms from other rocks by heat and pressure are usually found near convergent boundaries (plates coming together) are classified according to texture 
5.3.5.4.2	Foliated metamorphic rocks have mineral grains within the rock that are arranged in nearly parallel layers.
5.3.5.4.3	Examples: slate, schist, and gneiss.
5.3.5.4.4	Non-foliated metamorphic rocks have mineral grains that change, grow and rearrange but don't form parallel layers.
5.3.5.4.5	Examples: quartzite, marble.
5.3.5.4.6	Key Vocabulary: clastic, extrusive, foliated, igneous, intrusive, metamorphic, non-clastic, non-foliated, sedimentary
5.3.5.5.1	Part Five: The Rock Cycle
5.3.5.5.2	The rock cycle shows how the earth's rocks are changed again and again.
5.3.5.5.3	The rocks can be changed at times to another type of rock.
5.3.5.5.4	The rock cycle can begin anywhere in the cycle.
5.3.5.5.5	Here's how it works.
5.3.5.5.6	Igneous rocks start as magma.
5.3.5.5.7	Technically, ALL rocks start as magma.
5.3.5.5.8	The magma (molten rock under the surface) and lava (molten rock on the surface) hardens into igneous rock.
5.3.5.5.9	The igneous rock then breaks apart over time through the process of weathering.
5.3.5.5.10	These bits of broken rock are washed away by rains and deposited in a river.
5.3.5.5.11	These pieces of igneous rocks are cemented together with other bits of rock and form a sedimentary rock called conglomerate.
5.3.5.5.12	Over time sedimentary rocks can be buried by earthquakes or other geologic processes.
5.3.5.5.13	Being buried deep under the surface in areas of high temperatures and pressures or coming in contact with magma can cause these sedimentary rocks to change to metamorphic rocks.
5.3.5.5.14	Metamorphic, sedimentary or igneous rocks can be remelted to form magma, beginning at the beginning again.
5.3.5.6.1	Rocks are changed by processes such as.
5.3.5.6.2	weathering and erosion (and deposition) to form sediments
5.3.5.6.3	-Weathering is the process that breaks rocks into smaller pieces called sediments.
5.3.5.6.4	-Erosion is the movement of weathered materials to new locations, where they are then deposited.
5.3.5.6.5	-Deposition is the laying down of rock forming material from any natural process.
5.3.5.6.6	-Sediments are small pieces of loose materials such as rock fragments, mineral grains, and bits of plant and animal remains.
5.3.5.6.7	compaction and cementation
5.3.5.6.8	- Compaction occurs when small sediments stick together to form solid rock.
5.3.5.6.9	- Cementation occurs when large sediments are glued together by minerals deposited between the sediments.
5.3.5.6.10	melting :­ when rocks are buried deep enough to be melted back into magma cooling and hardening ­ allows crystals to form heat and pressure ­ when existing rocks are buried deep and are heated by a nearby source of magma
5.3.5.6.11	Key Vocabulary: cementation/compaction, cooling and hardening, deposition, heat/pressure, lava, magma, melting, rock cycle, sediment, weathering/erosion

5.4.2.1.1	Part One: Earth's Composition
5.4.2.1.2	The Earth is composed of four different layers.
5.4.2.1.3	Many geologists believe that as the Earth cooled the heavier, denser materials sank to the center and the lighter materials rose to the top.
5.4.2.1.4	These four layers are.
5.4.2.2.1	The crust is the outer layer of the Earth and is made of the lightest materials (rock- basalts and granites).
5.4.2.2.2	The crust is the layer that you live on, and it is the most widely studied and understood.
5.4.2.2.3	It is cool and brittle (rocky).
5.4.2.3.1	The mantle is much hotter and has the ability to flow.
5.4.2.3.2	It is the largest/thickest layer.
5.4.2.3.3	The mantle is composed of very hot, dense, flowing rock.
5.4.2.3.4	The material in the mantle flows because of convection currents.
5.4.2.3.5	This causes the brittle crust to move as it floats on top of the mantle.
5.4.2.3.6	It is like a warm plastic.
5.4.2.3.7	It is also made up of two parts.
5.4.2.3.8	the lithosphere (which is the top portion of the mantle as well as the crust) and the asthenosphere (which is the lower part of the mantle that has the convection currents).
5.4.2.4.1	The outer core is even hotter, consists of heavy metals (nickel and iron) and is liquid.
5.4.2.5.1	The inner core is hotter still with pressures so great that the heavy metals it is made of (nickel and iron) that they are in a solid state in spite of having the hottest temperatures.
5.4.2.6.1	There are two types of crust material.
5.4.2.6.2	The continental crust is thicker but lighter.
5.4.2.6.3	It is made up of mostly granite which is less dense.
5.4.2.6.4	The oceanic crust is thinner but heavier.
5.4.2.6.5	It is made up of mostly basalt which is more dense.
5.4.2.7.1	Convection currents are a circular current caused by the difference in temperatures from the bottom to the top of the mantle.
5.4.2.7.2	It is because of these currents that the plates of the Earth have moved in the past and are moving today.
5.4.2.7.3	These plate movements cause earthquakes, mountain building, and volcanism.
5.4.2.7.4	Key Vocabulary: continental crust, convection, crust, inner core, mantle, oceanic crust, outer core
5.4.3.1.1	Part Two: Plate Tectonic Processes and Landforms
5.4.3.1.2	The Earth's crust is broken into many pieces.
5.4.3.1.3	These pieces are called plates.
5.4.3.1.4	The movement of these plates is called plate tectonics.
5.4.3.1.5	There are twelve main plates on the Earth's surface.
5.4.3.1.6	The Earth's plates are in constant, but very, very slow motion.
5.4.3.1.7	They move at only 1/2 to 4 inches (1.3 to 10 centimeters) per year!
5.4.3.1.8	The Continental Drift Theory states that the continents have moved and are still moving today.
5.4.3.1.9	In 1912 Alfred Wegener introduced this theory, but he did not fully understand what caused the plates to move.
5.4.3.1.10	Scientists believe that 250 millions years ago the Earth's seven continents were all grouped together into a super continent called Pangaea.
5.4.3.1.11	Scientists have used magnetic bands in rocks to prove that the continents have drifted apart, fossils of tropical plants and animals that have been found in places like Antarctica and Greenland, and fossils of fish found in high mountain regions.
5.4.3.2.1	A plate boundary occurs where two plates come together.
5.4.3.2.2	There are three kinds of plate boundaries.
5.4.3.3.1	A convergent boundary is where two plates collide to form mountains or one plate riding above the other driving the thinner denser plate down into the mantle creating a subduction zone.
5.4.3.3.2	Trenches form at subduction zones.
5.4.3.3.3	They are the deepest part of the oceans and the lowest points on the crust of the Earth.
5.4.3.3.4	Subduction zones are areas of the world in which high amounts of earthquakes and volcanism is present.
5.4.3.3.5	There are 3 types of convergent boundaries, all of which are the result of compression forces (pressing together).
5.4.3.3.6	- ocean-to-ocean, where 2 oceanic plates collide, forming a subduction zone, a trench and a volcanic island arc chain (example: Aleutian Island Arc Chain, Alaska and the Japanese Island Arc Chain)
5.4.3.3.7	- ocean-to-continent, where an oceanic plate collides with a continental plate, forming a subduction zone, a trench and continental volcanoes (example: Andes Mountains of South America)
5.4.3.3.8	- continent-to-continent, where 2 continental plates collide forming folded and faulted mountains with no volcanoes (example: Appalachian Mountains and Himalayan Mountains) 
5.4.3.4.1	A divergent boundary is where two plates are moving in opposite directions.
5.4.3.4.2	Divergent boundaries cause the oceans to spread apart (as a result of tension force, pulling apart) while convergent boundaries cause the oceans to shrink.
5.4.3.4.3	There are two types of divergent boundaries.
5.4.3.4.4	- seafloor spreading is where two oceanic plates are moving apart and a mid-ocean ridge is formed.
5.4.3.4.5	As they spread apart magma fills the void causing the formation of new crust.
5.4.3.4.6	This separating is called rifting. In the middle of the mid-ocean ridge is a rift valley (example: Mid- Atlantic Ridge).
5.4.3.4.7	- a rift valley can also be the result of two continental plates moving apart. It is the same as seafloor
5.4.3.4.8	spreading except that it occurs on land (example: The Great African Rift Valley).
5.4.3.5.1	A transform boundary is where two plates are sliding past each other by a force called shearing.
5.4.3.5.2	Transform boundaries are like tears in the Earth's crust.
5.4.3.5.3	An example is the San Andreas Fault.
5.4.3.5.4	Key Vocabulary: compression force, continental drift, convergent boundary, divergent boundary, faulting, folding, island arc, mid-ocean ridge, plate tectonics, rifting, rift valley, seafloor spreading, shearing force, subduction, tension force, transform boundary, trench
5.4.4.1.1	Part Three: Mountains
5.4.4.1.2	The movement of tectonic plates is responsible for the formation of mountains.
5.4.4.1.3	Folded mountains are a wave-like formation. Continental plates are pushed together and form tall mountains.
5.4.4.1.4	Fault-block mountains occur when the plates are pushed together and break from the collision. 
5.4.4.1.5	These mountains have very rough linear peaks.
5.4.4.1.6	If one fault is present, it forms a tilted mountain.
5.4.4.1.7	If two faults are present a lifted mountain is formed.
5.4.4.1.8	Dome mountains form when plate collisions push an area of the crust up into a dome shape.
5.4.4.1.9	The crust doesn't snap and break as in fault-block mountains.
5.4.4.1.10	Key Vocabulary: dome mountain, fault-block mountain, folded mountain
5.4.5.1.1	Part Four: Earthquakes and Faults
5.4.5.1.2	Earthquake activity is associated with all plate boundaries because those plates are in motion.
5.4.5.1.3	The plates do not move smoothly and evenly.
5.4.5.1.4	Great stresses build up along the plate boundaries.
5.4.5.1.5	An earthquake is a shaking of Earth's crust caused by a release of energy.
5.4.5.1.6	When a plate moves suddenly a great amount of energy is released in the form of wave energy.
5.4.5.1.7	These waves are what cause the damage from an earthquake.
5.4.5.1.8	The focus is the point in Earth's interior where energy is released.
5.4.5.1.9	This is where the first movement occurs.
5.4.5.1.10	The epicenter is the point at the surface above the focus.
5.4.5.2.1	Seismic Waves are the energy waves that move outward from the earthquake focus and make the ground quake.
5.4.5.2.2	There are three types of seismic waves.
5.4.5.2.3	Primary waves (P wave) move through Earth and cause particles in rocks to move in a push-pull motion.
5.4.5.2.4	The force involved is compression.
5.4.5.2.5	Secondary waves (S wave) move through Earth, causing particles to move side to side at right angles to the direction of the wave.
5.4.5.2.6	The force involved is shearing.
5.4.5.2.7	Surface or Long waves (L wave) move on the surface giving particles an elliptical and more rolling motion.
5.4.5.2.8	When P and S waves reach the surface, they set up the L wave.
5.4.5.2.9	The force involved is tension.
5.4.5.3.1	Magnitude is the measure of the strength of the seismic waves that have been sent out from the focus.
5.4.5.3.2	A seismograph is an instrument that records the length and severity of an earthquake on a seismogram. 
5.4.5.3.3	The P- and S-wave information from 3 geographic locations is required to determine the
5.4.5.3.4	actual location of an earthquake.
5.4.5.3.5	The Richter scale is used to measure the strength of an earthquake.
5.4.5.3.6	The scale ranges from a low of 1 to a high of 10.
5.4.5.3.7	The Mercalli scale measures severity of damage of earthquakes that occurred before the invention of the seismograph.
5.4.5.3.8	This scale ranges from a low of I to a high of XII.
5.4.5.4.1	A fault is a break or crack in the Earth's surface along which movement has occurred.
5.4.5.4.2	On either side of most faults is a hanging wall and a foot wall.
5.4.5.4.3	The hanging wall is the rock above the fault.
5.4.5.4.4	The foot wall is the rock below the fault.
5.4.5.4.5	There are 4 basic types of faults.
5.4.5.4.6	A normal fault is caused by the force of tension when rocks pull apart (divergent plates).
5.4.5.4.7	A reverse fault is caused by forces of compression when rocks are pushed together (convergent plates).
5.4.5.4.8	A thrust fault is like a reverse fault that is not only pushed together but where the hanging wall is pushed over and on top of the foot wall.
5.4.5.4.9	Strike-slip Faults are caused by shearing forces when rocks slide past each other.
5.4.5.4.10	Key Vocabulary: compression force, earthquake, epicenter, focus, Mercalli Scale, normal fault, reverse fault, Richter Scale, seismic waves (P,S,L), seismogram, seismograph, shearing force, strike-slip fault, tension force, thrust fault
5.4.6.1.1	Part Five: Volcanoes
5.4.6.1.2	The motion of the Earth's plates help scientists to understand why volcanoes occur.
5.4.6.1.3	Volcanoes are openings in the earth's surface where magma is released as lava.
5.4.6.1.4	Magma is molten rock that is under the Earth's crust.
5.4.6.1.5	Lava is molten rock that that reaches the Earth's surface.
5.4.6.1.6	Active volcanoes spew smoke, steam, ash, cinder, lava.
5.4.6.1.7	Volcanoes occur at: divergent boundaries, convergent boundaries, and hot spots.
5.4.6.1.8	The crater is depression at top of cone.
5.4.6.1.9	The cone is the body of the volcano.
5.4.6.1.10	The vent is the opening in crater where lava flows.
5.4.6.1.11	The magma chamber is the reservoir of magma underground beneath the volcano.
5.4.6.1.12	The volcanic neck forms when a dormant volcano has magma hardened in the vent and over many years the cone erodes away leaving this igneous column behind.
5.4.6.1.13	A caldera forms when the top of the volcano collapses into magma chamber, creating a deeper depression, sometimes forming a crater lake.
5.4.6.2.1	Volcanoes are classified by the eruption type, magma type and by the volcanic cone shape.
5.4.6.3.1	Shield volcanoes were named by Icelandic people because the shape reminded them of a warriors shield laid down.
5.4.6.3.2	Shield volcanoes form from hot, runny lava that is erupted from the volcano through its summit and the many side vents and fissures throughout the volcano's flanks (sides).
5.4.6.3.3	Shield volcanoes are low, very broad, and gently sloping.
5.4.6.3.4	Shield volcanoes have quiet eruptions.
5.4.6.3.5	Hot spot volcanoes are shield volcanoes.
5.4.6.3.6	They form because of a weak spot in the crust rather than from plate boundary action.
5.4.6.4.1	Cinder cones get their name from the material that forms them, cinders.
5.4.6.4.2	Cinder cones are the simplest volcanic formation.
5.4.6.4.3	They form from explosions of red, hot magma cinders and ash.
5.4.6.4.4	These cinders and ash settle around the main vent and build a steep sided cone.
5.4.6.4.5	Very little lava is erupted from a cinder cone.
5.4.6.4.6	Cinder cones very rarely rise to more than 1,000 feet above the surrounding landscape.
5.4.6.4.7	Cinder cones are known for their very violent, explosive, exciting eruptions.
5.4.6.5.1	Composite cones are formed from a combination of eruptions.
5.4.6.5.2	Composite volcanoes have quiet eruptions with easy flowing lava and violent eruptions with explosives tephra (lava that has hardened and broken into various size pieces, the debris thrown from volcanoes) layers made of alternating lava and tephra pieces.
5.4.6.5.3	A large composite cone will be built with many layers of ash and lava.
5.4.6.5.4	Composite cones are the most common type of volcanic cone.
5.4.6.5.5	Key Vocabulary: caldera, cinder cone volcano, composite volcano, cone, crater, hot spot, lava, magma, magma chamber, neck, shield volcano, vent

5.5.1.1.4	Weathering, erosion, and deposition processes change the surface of the earth and result in various landforms.
5.5.1.1.5	Describe how do agents of erosion affect the earth's surface.
5.5.1.1.6	Freshwater resources are influenced by geologic processes and the activities of humans.
5.5.1.1.7	How is freshwater influenced by geologic processes?
5.5.1.1.8	Explain the ways in which humans are dependent on freshwater.
5.5.1.1.9	How do human activities impact freshwater resources?
5.5.1.1.10	Earth undergoes regular patterns of change and natural cycles, both quickly and over time.
5.5.1.1.11	How do geologic processes affect the flow of water underground?
5.5.2.1.1	Part One: Physical and Chemical Weathering
5.5.2.1.2	Weathering is the process in which rocks break down into smaller pieces.
5.5.2.1.3	There are two methods by which this may occur.
5.5.2.1.4	Each method has several types.
5.5.2.2.1	Mechanical weathering, also called physical weathering, is when rocks are broken down into smaller pieces by mechanical means (wind, water, or ice).
5.5.2.2.2	It does not chemically change the rock in any way.
5.5.2.2.3	Ice wedging is a type of mechanical weathering in which breaks in rock result from the freezing and thawing of water.
5.5.2.2.4	It can also be called freeze/thaw or frost wedging.
5.5.2.2.5	Abrasion is a type of mechanical weathering in which breaking up of rocks occurs from their collisions with other rock.
5.5.2.2.6	Plant roots can cause weathering when the roots split rock material apart.
5.5.2.2.7	Animal activity such as burrowing physically or mechanically alters rock material.
5.5.2.2.8	Exfoliation occurs because of winds.
5.5.2.2.9	Friction of water running across rocks can weather rocks.
5.5.2.2.10	Temperature changes cause weathering due to the expansion and contraction of rock materials.
5.5.2.3.1	Chemical weathering, also called decomposition, is when rocks are broken down into smaller pieces by chemical action.
5.5.2.3.2	Chemical weathering will occur when chemical reactions take place between the minerals in the rock & water, carbon dioxide, oxygen & acids.
5.5.2.3.3	Hydrolysis occurs when minerals in rock react with water and the rock becomes less stable and is easily broken down into pieces.
5.5.2.3.4	Carbonation occurs whenCO reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H CO ).
5.5.2.3.5	This acid speeds up hydrolysis to form caves and sinkholes.
5.5.2.3.6	Oxidation occurs when metallic elements react with oxygen; usually found in Fe (iron) bearing minerals (form iron oxide or rust).
5.5.2.3.7	Plants produce acids that seep into rock and produce cracks in the rock.
5.5.2.3.8	Key Vocabulary: abrasion, animal activity, carbonation, chemical weathering, exfoliation, friction, hydrolysis, ice wedging, mechanical weathering, oxidation, plant acids, plant roots, temperature changes, weathering
5.5.3.1.1	Part Two: Soil Formation
5.5.3.1.2	Soil is a mixture of minerals, water, gases and humus (decomposed or decomposing plant and animal material); capable of supporting plant growth.
5.5.3.1.3	Soil development starts with the weathering of bedrock.
5.5.3.1.4	Organic material (living or once living things) must be present in order to have soil.
5.5.3.1.5	Residual soil is soil that has bedrock as its parent material.
5.5.3.1.6	Transported soil is formed from parent material left by winds, rivers, or glaciers, or soil that has been moved from its original location.
5.5.3.1.7	A layer of soil is a horizon and all of the horizons together form a soil profile. 
5.5.3.1.8	Soil profile consists of three man horizons: A- topsoil (humus), B- subsoil- minerals leached from layer A(less humus), C- partially weathered bedrock. 
5.5.3.1.9	You may also see O- (organic layer) and parent rock (bedrock from which soil forms) included as horizons.
5.5.3.1.10	Key Vocabulary: horizon, humus, organic, parent rock, soil profile, topsoil
5.5.4.1.1	Part Three: Erosion and Deposition
5.5.4.1.2	Erosion is the removal and transport of earth materials by natural agents.
5.5.4.1.3	It results in deposition (the depositing or laying down) of sediments elsewhere.
5.5.4.1.4	Common agents of soil erosion are gravity, glaciers, wind, and water.
5.5.4.1.5	Mass wasting is the movement of eroded fragments down a slope by gravity.
5.5.4.1.6	Slow mass movement (creep) is a slow, imperceptible downslope movement of the soil.
5.5.4.1.7	Rapid movement (landslide) is the sudden movement of a mass of bedrock or loose rock.
5.5.4.1.8	Slump is a rapid rotational movement where a portion of a hillside slips.
5.5.4.2.1	Water picks up speed and energy as it flows downhill due to gravity.
5.5.4.2.2	Runoff is the water that does not soak into the ground or evaporate. 
5.5.4.2.3	Water from run-off travels along the ground, eventually emptying into streams, lakes or oceans.
5.5.4.2.4	Some of the factors affecting runoff are: the amount of rain that falls, the amount of vegetation on the land, the time span over which it falls, the slope of the land (steepness) 
5.5.4.3.1	Stream erosion forms a deep and wide channel carrying many sizes of sediments.
5.5.4.3.2	A channel is the main part of the stream where the majority of the water flows.
5.5.4.3.3	The stream bank is the part of the stream channel that is above water.
5.5.4.3.4	The stream bed is the part of stream channel that is below the water.
5.5.4.3.5	Streams are classified by their ages.
5.5.4.3.6	Each age can be identified by landforms, the velocity, or speed, of the water and its carrying ability (the amount and size of sediments that it transports). 
5.5.4.3.7	Rivers always carve out a v-shaped valley.
5.5.4.4.1	Young streams flow quickly through a valley and has steep sides.
5.5.4.4.2	Large boulders can be moved by the fast moving water.
5.5.4.4.3	This digs out the bottom of the water, deepening and widening the channel.
5.5.4.4.4	This amount and size of sediment is called either bedload or traction.
5.5.4.5.1	Mature streams flow slower and starts to curve or meander through a valley.
5.5.4.5.2	The velocity of the water in mature streams can not carry boulders.
5.5.4.5.3	Large rocks can be bounced along the bottom.
5.5.4.5.4	These bouncing rocks are called saltation.
5.5.4.6.1	Old Streams flow slowly through a wide, flat floodplain.
5.5.4.6.2	The smallest sediments are found in this water.
5.5.4.6.3	These smaller sediments are either the suspended load (the sediments that suspended in the column of water) or the dissolved load (the dissolved material).
5.5.4.7.1	River water starts out in gullies & small streams; eventually these branching arms allow water to flow into a river.
5.5.4.7.2	River systems consist of tributaries, which are small streams that feed into rivers, the watershed, which is the land from which the water runs into the streams, and channel, which is the path that the stream follows.
5.5.4.7.3	Stream piracy is where one tributary overcomes another and they join together.
5.5.4.7.4	At the end of the river, sediments being carried by water are deposited.
5.5.4.7.5	A delta forms when a river hits a larger body of water the velocity decreases dramatically and sediments will settle in a fan shape.
5.5.4.7.6	An alluvial fan forms when sediments are deposited in a triangle shape at the base of a mountain stream.
5.5.4.7.7	The drainage basin is the area of land where a stream gets it water.
5.5.4.7.8	A meander is a curve in a stream.
5.5.4.7.9	On the outside of the curve, the water moves fastest and cuts into the banks, forming a cut bank.
5.5.4.7.10	On the inside of the curve, the water moves slower and drops heavier particles, forming a point bar.
5.5.4.7.11	The floodplain is the broad, flat valley floor that gets covered with water when a stream floor.
5.5.4.7.12	An oxbow lake is a meander that has closed off forming a lake.
5.5.4.8.1	A glacier is a `river' of ice.
5.5.4.8.2	There are two main types of glaciers.
5.5.4.8.3	A valley glacier is one that is found in the valleys of mountainous areas.
5.5.4.8.4	A continental glacier is one that is found covering large land masses like Antarctica.
5.5.4.8.5	Glaciers dig out areas, breaking up and picking up the rock below and depositing it further down the glacier, acting like a bulldozer.
5.5.4.8.6	Sometimes these pieces get pushed along the side of the glacier.
5.5.4.8.7	Either one, at the end or along the sides, the debris forms a moraine. Glaciers form u-shaped valleys.
5.5.4.8.8	Key Vocabulary: alluvial fan, bedload, carrying ability, channel, continental glacier, creep, delta, deposition, dissolved load, erosion, floodplain, glacier, landslide, mass wasting, moraine, runoff, saltation, slope, slump, stream piracy, suspended load, traction, tributary, u-shaped valley, v-shaped valley, valley glacier, velocity
5.5.5.1.1	Part Four: Karst Topography
5.5.5.1.2	Karst Topography refers to landforms made from dissolving limestone (a sedimentary rock commonly found in the Valley and Ridge Province of Virginia).
5.5.5.1.3	Karst Topography is characterized by several features that are produced by acidic groundwater dissolving limestone.
5.5.5.1.4	Caverns (caves) form from water that has dissolved limestone underground, leaving an opening.
5.5.5.1.5	Sinkholes form when the roof of a cave collapses, leaving a hole or depression on the Earth's surface.
5.5.5.1.6	Disappearing streams occur when streams drop into a sinkhole and continue to flow underground.
5.5.5.1.7	Stalactites form when water drips from top and calcite solidifies.
5.5.5.1.8	A mnemonic device for remembering this one is to remember the `c' in stalactite means it is coming from the ceiling and it is holding `tite' (tight).
5.5.5.1.9	Stalagmites form when dissolved calcite deposits on the floor.
5.5.5.1.10	A mnemonic device for remembering this one is to remember the `g' in stalagmite means it is coming from the ground and reaching up with all its `mite' (might).
5.5.5.1.11	When a stalactite and a stalagmite join together it is referred to as a column.
5.5.5.1.12	As groundwater passes through the bedrock, it dissolves minerals (usually calcium from calcite).
5.5.5.1.13	Hard water contains large amounts of dissolved minerals.
5.5.5.1.14	Soft water contains few dissolved minerals.
5.5.5.1.15	Key Vocabulary: calcite, cavern, column, disappearing stream, karst, limestone, sinkhole, stalactite, stalagmite
5.5.6.1.1	Part Five: Groundwater Zones and Sources of Freshwater
5.5.6.1.2	Seventy-five percent of the earth is covered by water. Ninety-seven percent of earth's water is salt water. 
5.5.6.1.3	Most of the fresh water is `locked up' in the glaciers and ice caps.
5.5.6.1.4	Less than 0.3% of all water is drinkable.
5.5.6.1.5	Water is distributed on Earth by means of the hydrologic cycle, also known as the water cycle.
5.5.6.1.6	The components of the water cycle are: 
5.5.6.1.7	evaporation:­ when water is changed from a liquid to a gaseous state 
5.5.6.1.8	condensation:­ when water is changed from a gaseous state to a liquid state in the atmosphere causing clouds
5.5.6.1.9	precipitation:­ when the liquid water is too heavy to remain in the clouds, falling to Earth in the form of rain, snow, sleet, hail, or freezing rain 
5.5.6.1.10	evapotranspiration:­ when moisture in a gaseous state is added to the atmosphere from trees, plants and animals
5.5.6.1.11	runoff:­ where water that falls in the form of precipitation does not soak into the ground but moves on the surface in streams, rivers, lakes or oceans 
5.5.6.1.12	groundwater:­ water in a liquid state that moves under the surface of the Earth 
5.5.6.2.1	It is found in surface water and in groundwater.
5.5.6.2.2	Groundwater is water that seeps down into soil and fills in the spaces (pores) between soil particles.
5.5.6.2.3	Porosity is the percentage of a material's volume that is pore space.
5.5.6.2.4	Porosity describes the pore space in a material, but it does not describe whether water can pass through the material.
5.5.6.2.5	Permeability is the rate at which water pass through the pore spaces of a rock.
5.5.6.2.6	Permeable describes soil and rock that allows water to pass through it.
5.5.6.2.7	Impermeable describes rock that water can not easily pass through.
5.5.6.3.1	Groundwater layers from the surface down would include zone of aeration, water table, and zone of saturation.
5.5.6.3.2	Groundwater continues to soak deeper into the ground through permeable rock until it reaches a layer of impermeable rock ­ stopping it from moving further.
5.5.6.3.3	The water backs up, filling the pores of the rock layer above the impermeable layer ­ this layer of ground where all pores are filled with water is the zone of saturation.
5.5.6.3.4	The upper layer of the zone of saturation is called the water table.
5.5.6.3.5	The zone of aeration is between the water table and Earth's surface.
5.5.6.3.6	An aquifer is a body of rock through which water flows or is stored.
5.5.6.4.1	There are other features that are related to groundwater.
5.5.6.4.2	Wells are drilled down to the zone of saturation.
5.5.6.4.3	A pump must be used to bring water to the surface.
5.5.6.4.4	An artesian well is a well in which water spouts out of an aquifer due to pressure from surrounding water, so no pump is necessary.
5.5.6.4.5	Where water is removed faster than it can be replaced, a cone of depression forms.
5.5.6.4.6	A spring is a natural flow of groundwater that flows to the earth's surface and flows out (source of freshwater); most are cold springs but some are hot.
5.5.6.4.7	In a hot spring, the water is heated by magma.
5.5.6.4.8	Geysers are hot spring that erupts periodically due to high heat and pressure underground.
5.5.6.4.9	Key Vocabulary: aquifer, artesian well, condensation, cone of depression, evaporation, evapotranspiration, geyser, groundwater, hot spring, hydrologic cycle, impermeable, permeability, permeable, porosity, precipitation, spring, water table, zone of aeration, zone of saturation

5.7.2.1.1	Part One: Fossil Formation and Types
5.7.2.1.2	A fossil is the remains, impressions, or other evidence of the former existence of life preserved in rock.
5.7.2.1.3	Examples are shells, bones, petrified trees, impressions made by leaves, insects in amber, footprints, or even burrows made by worms.
5.7.2.1.4	The evidence can be: 
5.7.2.1.5	mold -- ­a cavity left by an organism where the ground hardened before the organism had decayed
5.7.2.1.6	casts -- ­ where the cavity left by an organism has been filled, usually by minerals 
5.7.2.1.7	petrified remains --­ where there has been a molecule-for-molecule replacement of the original organism, turning it into a rock like object made of minerals 
5.7.2.1.8	Carbon film is the thin film of a carbon impression left by an object 
5.7.2.1.9	Original remains are when the actual remnants of an organism are discovered.
5.7.2.1.10	This may be in the form of a bone or tooth or shell, in frozen remains (like a wooly mammoth) or an insect in amber.
5.7.2.1.11	In each case, actually portions of the organism are found.
5.7.2.1.12	Trace fossils are not the actual organism but rather the evidence that an organism once existed.
5.7.2.1.13	Examples of this would include tracks, nests, or tools (for early humans).
5.7.2.2.1	Nearly all fossils are found in sedimentary rock.
5.7.2.2.2	Fossils are more likely to form if organisms have hard parts and if they are quickly buried.
5.7.2.2.3	Sometimes, fossils that lived in a wide geographic area, lived a short time and is easily recognizable is referred to as an index fossil.

5.7.3.1.1	Part Two: Relative Dating
5.7.3.1.2	Relative dating (also called relative time or relative age) places events in a sequence without assigning any numerical ages.
5.7.3.1.3	This does not give the time of the actual event, it just indicates the age in comparison with other events.
5.7.3.1.4	Most geologic work is done using relative time.
5.7.3.1.5	There are rules, laws and principles that are used to determine the relative age of rock layers.
5.7.3.1.6	These layers in one location are compared to layers in another location and based on the correlation (how the layer sequence matches up), scientists can determine what happened geologically They are.
5.7.3.1.7	Horizontality states that all rock layers are initially laid down horizontally.
5.7.3.1.8	If one or more layers are not horizontal this indicates some sort of tectonic action such as uplifting.
5.7.3.1.9	Superposition states that in a sequence of undisturbed sedimentary rocks, the oldest rock will be at the bottom of the sequence and the youngest will be at the top.
5.7.3.1.10	Cross-Cutting Relationships states that an igneous rock is younger than the rocks it has intruded (cut across).
5.7.3.1.11	One of these cross-cutting relationships is an igneous intrusion where magma is squeezed into cracks (faults) in rock layers or in between layers.
5.7.3.1.12	Also, the event that caused a fault is younger than any rocks the fault has cut across.
5.7.3.1.13	Included Fragments states that pieces of one rock found in another rock must be older than the rock in which they are found.
5.7.3.1.14	An unconformity is a place in the rock record where layers of rock are missing.
5.7.3.1.15	Unconformities are gaps in geologic time.

5.7.4.1.3	This is difficult and expensive to obtain.
5.7.4.1.4	Radioactive decay is used to determine the absolute age of rocks.
5.7.4.1.5	Half-life is the time required for half a given sample of a radioactive isotope to decay. 
5.7.4.1.6	Two things are absolutely consistent about half-life: the amount of time for each half life and the fact that 50% of the radioactive material will decay for each half-life (time and amount).
5.7.4.1.7	The original radioactive material is referred to as the parent material and the resulting decay material is referred to as the daughter material.
5.7.4.1.8	Carbon-14 is a method of dating that is only used on objects that were once living

5.7.5.1.5	Mostly, we deal with eras, which are also very large divisions.
5.7.5.1.6	Eras are major subdivisions based on differences in life forms.
5.7.5.1.7	Eras are divided into smaller segments called periods based on types of life existing at the time and geologic events.
5.7.5.1.8	Like eras, periods differ from one another in plant and animal life although less than between eras.
5.7.5.1.9	Some of the periods are further divided into epochs.
5.7.5.1.10	These divisions are shorter and changes in life are not as large as between periods.
5.7.5.1.11	The four major eras are:
5.7.5.2.1	Precambrian (which can be divided into Archeozoic and Proterozoic eras): The Precambrian Era began 4.6 billion years ago, when life first appeared. 
5.7.5.2.2	Life-forms present were cyanobacteria, invertebrates ­jellyfish, marine worms.
5.7.5.2.3	The Precambrian Era was the longest era.
5.7.5.2.4	It produced very few fossils.
5.7.5.2.5	Bacteria formed O , Ozone (O ) began to develop, and the atmosphere began to form.
5.7.5.3.1	Paleozoic: The Paleozoic Era (the age of marine invertebrates) is the second oldest era of our Earth's history.
5.7.5.3.2	Paleozoic means "Ancient Life" and lasted 345 million years.
5.7.5.3.3	This is the first era in which scientists have found numerous fossils.
5.7.5.3.4	It began about 600 million years ago with the first trilobites, a small, shelled sea creature resembling a modern crab.
5.7.5.3.5	The Paleozoic is called the "Age of Fish".
5.7.5.3.6	The continents were all connected into one huge landmass called Pangaea during the early Paleozoic.
5.7.5.4.1	Mesozoic: Mesozoic means "Middle Life" and began about 225 million years ago and ended about 70 million years ago.
5.7.5.4.2	This era is called the "Age of the Reptiles".
5.7.5.4.3	The era started with the rise of the dinosaurs.
5.7.5.4.4	The first birds were evolved during the Mesozoic.
5.7.5.4.5	The end of the Mesozoic was marked by the extinction of the dinosaurs.
5.7.5.4.6	There are numerous theories as to why the great dinosaurs became extinct.
5.7.5.4.7	The leading theory is that an asteroid hit in an area called the Chicxulub Crater in Mexico.
5.7.5.4.8	This would have caused tremendous climate change in a short amount of time which the dinosaurs were unable to adapt to, causing their extinction.
5.7.5.5.1	Cenozoic: The Cenozoic Era is also called the "Age of the Mammals".
5.7.5.5.2	It began about 65 million years ago as the great lizards, the dinosaurs became extinct.
5.7.5.5.3	This led to a rise in the mammal population.
5.7.5.5.4	We are currently living in the Cenozoic Era, the Quarternary Period and the Holocene Epoch.
5.7.5.5.5	Key Vocabulary: Cenozoic, eon, epoch, era, Mesozoic, Paleozoic, period, Precambrian
5.7.6.1.1	Part Five: Origin of Earth's Atmosphere
5.7.6.1.2	The early atmosphere contained little oxygen and more carbon dioxide than the modern atmosphere.
5.7.6.1.3	Early life such as cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) consumed carbon dioxide and generated oxygen by a process called photosynthesis.
5.7.6.1.4	It was only after early photosynthetic life generated oxygen that animal life became possible.
5.7.6.1.5	Part of the oxygen created combined to form ozone which protects us from harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.

5.8.3.2.3	There are 5 major rivers that flow into the bay.
5.8.3.2.4	From South to North, they are The James, York, Rappahannock, Potomac, and the Susquehanna Rivers.
5.8.3.2.5	The Susquehanna River provides about 50% of the fresh water coming into the Bay.
5.8.3.2.6	The river empties an average of 19 million gallons of water per minute.
5.8.3.2.7	The Bay area is home to over 15,000,000 people!
5.8.3.2.8	About 50,000 commercial vessels enter the Bay each year.
5.8.3.2.9	All these people and activities put a strain on the Bay ecology.
5.8.3.3.1	The Bay is home to over 3600 species of living organisms and has 5 basic communities.
5.8.3.3.2	Marsh dwellers are located in and around marshes.

5.8.3.4.4	This is the most common type in Virginia.
5.8.3.4.5	Example: Farmers and homeowners fertilize their farms or lawns.
5.8.3.4.6	That fertilizer ends up in the rivers and eventually into the Bay.
5.8.3.4.7	In the rivers and the Bay, the fertilizer causes major algae blooms.
5.8.3.4.8	These algae blooms block out the sunlight.
5.8.3.4.9	The plants on the bottom cannot receive sunlight and die off.

5.9.2.1.1	Part One: Interacting Processes and Systems
5.9.2.1.2	The ocean covers 70 % of the Earth.
5.9.2.1.3	It contains dissolved salts with ions such as chloride, sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
5.9.2.1.4	Salinity is a measure if the amount of salts dissolved in seawater.
5.9.2.1.5	Almost all of the energy that heats up the oceans comes from the sun, but light and heat do not penetrate very deeply into the ocean.
5.9.2.2.1	Oceanographers divide the ocean into three temperature layers.
5.9.2.2.2	The surface zone is warm with sunlight.
5.9.2.2.3	The surface zone is also called the mixed layer because wind and waves mix heat evenly through this zone.
5.9.2.2.4	The layer of ocean directly beneath the mixed layer, in which the temperature changes rapidly, is called the thermocline.
5.9.2.2.5	This middle zone is penetrated by little light.
5.9.2.2.6	The middle zone has a cold temperature.
5.9.2.2.7	The deep zone is very cold and has no sunlight.
5.9.2.3.1	Ocean water moves by currents and waves.
5.9.2.3.2	Currents are mass movements or flows of ocean water.
5.9.2.3.3	Most waves on the ocean surface are generated by wind.
5.9.2.3.4	The top of a wave is the crest; the bottom is the trough.
5.9.2.3.5	The distance between two crests or troughs is the wavelength.
5.9.2.3.6	The distance between the crest and the trough is the wave height.
5.9.2.3.7	A tsunami is a very large wave produced by seismic activity on the ocean floor.
5.9.2.3.8	The tides are the daily periodic rise and fall of water level caused by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon.
5.9.2.3.9	Spring tides occur when the Sun, Earth and Moon are in a straight line making high tides higher and low tides lower.
5.9.2.3.10	Neap tides occur when the Sun and the Moon are at right angles to the Earth making high tides lower and low tides higher.
5.9.2.3.11	There are large current systems in the oceans that carry warm water towards the poles and cold water towards the equator.
5.9.2.3.12	They move by convection and by density.
5.9.2.3.13	Estuaries, like the Chesapeake Bay, are areas where fresh and salt water mix, producing variations in salinity and high biological activity.
5.9.2.3.14	Upwelling brings cold, nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean to the surface and are areas of rich biological activity.
5.9.2.3.15	Sea level falls when glacial ice caps grow and rises when ice caps melt.

5.9.3.1.4	The continental slope is the zone of steeply sloped sea floor leading from the continental shelf toward the ocean bottom.
5.9.3.1.5	Separating the continental slope from the ocean bottom is the continental rise and is made up of sediments, or small bits of rock and plant and animal remains.
5.9.3.1.6	The abyssal plain is a flat stretch of the deep ocean around the margins of the continents.
5.9.3.1.7	In the abyssal plain you may find seamounts which are underwater volcanoes at current or former location of hot spots.
5.9.3.1.8	In the abyssal plain you may also find guyots which are seamounts that are no longer active and have flat tops due to erosion by water movement.
5.9.3.1.9	Mid-ocean ridges are chains of underwater mountains that run throughout the ocean basins and are a result of plate tectonic movement at a divergent boundary.
5.9.3.1.10	This is where magma is squeezing through the crack in the plates and is building up into ridges.
5.9.3.1.11	In the middle of the mid-ocean ridge is the rift valley. This is the location of the `crack' in the plates.
5.9.3.1.12	Expect to find volcanic activity.
5.9.3.1.13	The deepest places in the ocean are called trenches.

5.10.3.1.2	Atmospheric regulation mechanisms including the effects of density differences and energy transfer.
5.10.3.1.3	Three things can happen when Earth receives energy from the sun: reflection ­ Reflection occurs when energy is reflected back into space.
5.10.3.1.4	atmospheric absorption ­ Atmospheric absorption occurs when energy is absorbed by the atmosphere.
5.10.3.1.5	land/water absorption ­ Land/water absorption occurs when energy is absorbed by the surface.
5.10.3.1.6	The land heats and cools more rapidly than the ocean.
5.10.3.1.7	The oceans store heat.
5.10.3.2.1	Energy is transferred by radiation, conduction, and convection.

5.10.3.2.5	Smog and pollution keep some energy from being reflected, making areas hotter.
5.10.3.2.6	Conduction is the transfer of heat thru direct contact (molecules bumping into one another) You have seen examples of conduction in your everyday life such as when feet get hot on hot asphalt or when pan gets hot on a hot burner.
5.10.3.2.7	Convection is the transfer of heat by the flow of a heated material (either gas or liquid).
5.10.3.2.8	Heat rises, cold falls creating convection currents.

5.10.4.1.5	Climate is an average of the weather over a long period of time in a certain area.
5.10.4.1.6	Latitude, large bodies of water, mountains (elevation), and seasons affect climate.
5.10.4.1.7	Latitude affects climate and how the energy is received from the sun.
5.10.4.1.8	Near the poles the sun's energy is spread thinly over a large area.
5.10.4.1.9	Near the equator, the sun's energy is spread out less.
5.10.4.1.10	Here the sunlight is more direct.
5.10.4.1.11	Large bodies of water will affect the climate for a particular area.
5.10.4.1.12	Water heats up and cools down more slowly than land.
5.10.4.1.13	Usually coastal areas are in warmer in summer and cooler in winter.
5.10.4.1.14	Sea breezes and warm ocean currents play a role.
5.10.4.1.15	The presence of mountains will affect the climate of a given area.
5.10.4.1.16	It's cooler up higher (less air molecules to absorb heat).
5.10.4.1.17	The windward side of mountains are wetter (wind, moisture, rain).
5.10.4.1.18	On the leeward side of mountains (no wind) air heats up and dries things out.
5.10.4.1.19	As moist air is pushed up a mountain, it cools.
5.10.4.1.20	Cool air cannot hold water as well as warm air so condensation occurs.
5.10.4.1.21	At some point, precipitation follows.
5.10.4.1.22	Seasons Affect Climate and the way energy is received by the Earth.
5.10.4.1.23	Summer ­ more direct radiation (tilt toward the sun).
5.10.4.1.24	Winter ­ less radiation (tilt away from the sun).
5.10.4.1.25	Fall and Spring ­ equal distribution of radiation.
5.10.4.2.1	Water/Precipitation in the atmosphere comes in several forms: Hail ­ lumps of ice, formed by rain drops that get blown back up into the cloud, freezes, accumulates layers of rain, drops down, gets blown back up into the cloud by strong updrafts, continuing the freezing, blowing back up, layering until the weight is greater than the force of the air blowing back up into the cloud when it falls as hail.
5.10.4.2.2	Depending on how may `blow back' trips it makes, it could get very large.
5.10.4.2.3	High wind storms tend to produce hail.

5.10.4.2.6	freezing rain:­ freezes, melts, then re-freezes upon contact with freezing temperatures at the surface
5.10.4.3.1	Humidity and factors that affect it.
5.10.4.3.2	Relative humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air compared to the total amount of water that the air can hold at that temperature.
5.10.4.3.3	Saturated = 100% humidity at that temperature.
5.10.4.3.4	The dew point is the temperature at which the air is saturated and condensation occurs.
5.10.4.3.5	Cooler temperature = less humidity (water vapor is able to condense into clouds).
5.10.4.3.6	Higher temperature = more humidity (water vapor is unable to condense into clouds due to faster motion of molecules).
5.10.4.4.1	Air that stays in one area for a long time takes on the weather of that area.
5.10.4.4.2	Air masses are large bodies of air that have the same characteristics as the surface over which it developed.
5.10.4.4.3	For example: If air stays in the Artic, it becomes cold.
5.10.4.4.4	If air stays over the ocean, it becomes moist.

5.10.4.5.4	A cold front occurs when cold air mass pushes under warm air mass.
5.10.4.5.5	Narrow bands of storms are produced.
5.10.4.5.6	A warm front occurs when warm air mass goes over a cold air mass.
5.10.4.5.7	Wide bands of precipitation is produced.
5.10.4.5.8	An occluded front occurs when two cold air masses merge, forcing warm air up.
5.10.4.5.9	Strong winds and heavy precipitation are produced.

5.10.4.7.2	High Pressure: ­ air descends difficult for clouds to form (usually NICE Weather).
5.10.4.7.3	Low Pressure:­ air rises and clouds form (BAD Weather) 
5.10.4.8.1	A cloud is a visible collection of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air.
5.10.4.8.2	Clouds form as warm air rises, is cooled below its dew point, and condenses.
5.10.4.8.3	When humidity reaches 100%, water vapor condenses around nuclei (dust, salt, smoke in the atmosphere).
5.10.4.8.4	Drops of water are so small, they are suspended in the air.
5.10.4.8.5	Millions of these tiny water drops make a cloud.
5.10.4.9.1	If air movement is mainly horizontal, clouds form in layers.
5.10.4.9.2	These are called stratus clouds.
5.10.4.9.3	If air movement is mainly vertical, clouds grow upward in great piles.

5.10.4.10.2	Pressure is the result of collisions of air molecules with objects, and with each other.
5.10.4.10.3	Pressure = force/area Changes in atmospheric pressure result from changes in: temperature, moisture content, and elevation.
5.10.4.11.1	Atmospheric temperature changes from layer to layer.
5.10.4.11.2	Gases expand when they are heated and contract when they are cooled.
5.10.4.11.3	As a result, hot air is less dense than cool air.
5.10.4.11.4	Increasing air temperature decreases atmospheric pressure.
5.10.4.11.5	Decreasing air temperature increases atmospheric pressure.
5.10.4.12.1	Water vapor is lighter than nitrogen and oxygen, so adding water vapor makes air lighter; the pressure underneath is lowered.
5.10.4.12.2	Air has weight because gravity pulls air molecules toward the earth's surface.
5.10.4.12.3	Near the ground, the air pressure is greater due to the weight of many air molecules pressing down from above.
5.10.4.12.4	At higher elevations, there is less air to press on a given area.
5.10.4.12.5	Air pressure is less at higher elevations.
5.10.4.12.6	Air pressure is greatest at sea level.
5.10.4.13.1	Wind is caused by an uneven heating of earth's atmosphere causing pressure differences.
5.10.4.13.2	Air ALWAYS moves from high to low pressure creating a circulation.
5.10.4.13.3	Sea breezes come from the sea during the day.

5.10.4.14.1	The Coriolis Effect causes a change in wind direction.
5.10.4.14.2	It causes cold moving air from the poles to move toward the west.
5.10.4.14.3	The Coriolis Effect is the effect of earth's rotation on the movement of air masses.
5.10.4.14.4	North of the equator wind deflects to the right.

5.11.1.1.10	How does the location of a body in the solar system determine its characteristics?
5.11.1.1.11	Space exploration and technological advances have increased knowledge of the universe.
5.11.1.1.12	In what ways have space exploration and technological advances increased knowledge of the universe?
5.11.2.1.1	Part One: The Solar System
5.11.2.1.2	There are two groups of planets in our solar system.
5.11.2.1.3	According to the International Astronomical Union (the organization responsible for naming ANYTHING in the heavens, the new definition for planet is "A "planet" is an object in orbit around the Sun that is large enough (massive enough) to have its self-gravity pull itself into a round (or nearly round) shape.
5.11.2.1.4	In addition a "planet" orbits in a clear path around the Sun, there are no other bodies in its path that it must sweep up as it goes around the Sun.
5.11.2.2.1	The Inner Planets are closest to the sun.
5.11.2.2.2	These planets are solid, rocky, dense, and small.
5.11.2.2.3	They are referred to as terrestrial planets.
5.11.2.2.4	The Inner Planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
5.11.2.3.1	The Outer Planets are farther from the sun.
5.11.2.3.2	The first four of these planets are gaseous, and are less dense and large.
5.11.2.3.3	The Outer Planets are: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.
5.11.2.3.4	Although Pluto is an outer planet, it is the smallest planet and it is a rocky planet.
5.11.2.3.5	It was recently `demoted' to dwarf planet status.
5.11.2.4.1	Between Mars and Jupiter is the asteroid belt.
5.11.2.4.2	Asteroids are rocky or metallic iron objects ranging in size from millimeters to kilometers.
5.11.2.4.3	Tens of thousands of asteroids orbit harmlessly in a region referred to as the asteroid belt but on occasion, they will collide, sending one or both into odd orbits that may interfere with the orbit of a planet.
5.11.2.5.1	The Solar Nebula Theory states that debris left over from the beginning of the universe condensed to form the Sun and the planets.
5.11.2.5.2	The solar system consists of the Sun and all of the objects that are gravitationally bound to it.
5.11.2.6.1	There are numerous other objects and regions of objects in the solar system.
5.11.2.6.2	Past the orbit of Pluto is the Kuiper Belt.
5.11.2.6.3	It is a region similar to the asteroid belt.
5.11.2.6.4	It is now considered that Pluto is actually a Kuiper Belt object.
5.11.2.7.1	The Oort Cloud is a region past the Kuiper Belt and it is believed that comets originate here.
5.11.2.7.2	A comet is a mass of frozen gasses, dusts and rock particles.
5.11.2.7.3	They orbit the Sun in a regular period.
5.11.2.7.4	The tail of a comet always faces away from the Sun due to the solar winds coming from the Sun.
5.11.2.7.5	Sometimes, they cross the path of Earth's orbit.
5.11.2.7.6	When Earth goes through the debris stream from the remnants of a comet, we have a meteor shower.
5.11.2.7.7	We will go through that same debris trail every year.
5.11.2.8.1	There are other objects that interact with Earth.
5.11.2.8.2	They are meteoroids, meteors and meteorites.
5.11.2.8.3	A meteoroid is a small rocky object that travels in space.
5.11.2.8.4	It is generally considered to be much smaller than an asteroid.
5.11.2.8.5	A meteor is a meteoroid that enters Earth's atmosphere and burns up.
5.11.2.8.6	A meteorite is a meteor that doesn't completely burn up and strikes the Earth.
5.11.2.9.1	There are two major measurements used in astronomy.
5.11.2.9.2	An astronomical unit (AU) is the average distance between the Sun and the Earth.
5.11.2.9.3	This is approximately 93 million miles.
5.11.2.9.4	A light year (LY) is the distance light travels in one year.
5.11.2.9.5	This distance is approximately 9.5 trillion miles.
5.11.2.9.6	Key Vocabulary: asteroid, asteroid belt, astronomical unit, comet, gaseous planet, Kuiper Belt, light year, meteor, meteorite, meteoroid, Oort Cloud, planet, Solar Nebula Theory, solar system, terrestrial planet
5.11.3.1.1	Part: Two: Sun-Earth-Moon System
5.11.3.1.2	When a satellite travels around another object, this is called revolution.
5.11.3.1.3	Rotation is the word used to describe a satellite turning on its axis.
5.11.3.1.4	The Earth completes one revolution, or one orbit, around the sun every year (365 days, 6 hours, and 9 minutes).
5.11.3.1.5	The Earth completes one rotation, or turn on its axis every day (23hours, 56 minutes).
5.11.3.1.6	An axis is an imaginary line on which an object spins.
5.11.3.1.7	Our moon rotates, or spins on its axis once every 29.5 days.
5.11.3.1.8	Our moon revolves around the Earth once every 27.3 days.
5.11.3.1.9	It takes the same amount of time for the moon to rotate and revolve, so the same side of the moon always faces the Earth.
5.11.3.1.10	The difference in days between rotation and revolution has to do with the fact that the Earth is also revolving around the Sun and is farther in its orbit when the moon makes one complete revolution.
5.11.3.1.11	The moon is tidally locked to the Earth, meaning the same side of the moon always faces the earth.
5.11.3.1.12	There is one side of the moon that we never see.
5.11.3.1.13	This is called the "Far Side of the Moon".
5.11.3.2.1	The moon is a natural satellite of Earth.
5.11.3.2.2	The moon shines due to Sun reflecting off of its surface.
5.11.3.2.3	This causes the phases of the moon.
5.11.3.2.4	When there is a new moon, the lighted side of the moon can't be seen from Earth.
5.11.3.2.5	When there is a full moon, the entire lighted side of the moon can be seen.
5.11.3.2.6	When there is a small sliver of the lit side visible from Earth it is a crescent phase.
5.11.3.2.7	When one half of what we see from Earth is lit it is a quarter phase.
5.11.3.2.8	When most, but not all, of what we see from Earth is lit it is a gibbous phase.
5.11.3.2.9	The waxing phases occur when just after a new moon, more and more of the lighted side of the moon can be seen.
5.11.3.2.10	The moon appears to change from all dark to all light.
5.11.3.2.11	The waning phases occur when just after a full moon, less and less of the lighted side of the moon can be seen.
5.11.3.2.12	The moon appears to change from all light to all dark.
5.11.3.2.13	In order, the moon phases are new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, third or last quarter, waning crescent and back to the new moon.
5.11.3.2.14	Two mnemonics to help you remember what the phases are as well as the difference between waxing and waning: 
5.11.3.2.15	1) When the light is on the right, the moon is getting bright.
5.11.3.2.16	2) Waxing is maxing and waning is draining.
5.11.3.2.17	A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth moves between the sun and the moon.
5.11.3.2.18	A solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the Sun.
5.11.3.3.1	Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the ocean.
5.11.3.3.2	A tidal change is actually a wave.
5.11.3.3.3	Spring tide causes high tides that are especially high and low tides that are especially low.
5.11.3.3.4	Neap tide causes high tides that are not very high and low tides that are not very low.
5.11.3.3.5	The tidal range is the difference in levels between high tide and low tide.
5.11.3.4.1	Some final terms associated with the Earth-Sun-Moon relationship
5.11.3.4.2	A season is a regular, short-term period of change in the climate of an area due to changes in the amount of solar radiation the area receives.
5.11.3.4.3	Seasons have NOTHING to do with how close we are to the Sun.
5.11.3.4.4	Seasons are caused by: the revolution of Earth around the Sun, the tilt of the Earth's axis, and the parallelism of the Earth's axis.
5.11.3.4.5	Key Vocabulary: axis, crescent, full moon, gibbous, lunar eclipse, neap tide, new moon, phases, quarter, revolution, rotation, season, solar eclipse, spring tide, tidal range, tide, tilt, waning, waxing
5.11.4.1.1	Part Three: Sun
5.11.4.1.2	Our solar system's star is the Sun.
5.11.4.1.3	It is a middle aged star and is about 4.5 to 5 billion years old.
5.11.4.1.4	It should continue for another 4.5 to 5 billion years.
5.11.4.1.5	The Sun has 4 main layers and there are a few surface features that are important.
5.11.4.1.6	The core is in the center of the sun and is where nuclear fusion occurs.
5.11.4.1.7	It is the most dense portion of the star and its temperature is about 15 million degrees Celsius.
5.11.4.1.8	There is an area between the core and the atmosphere where convection moves energy from the center of the sun to the surface.
5.11.4.2.1	The atmosphere of the sun is made up of 3 parts.
5.11.4.2.2	The photosphere is the brightest and lowest layer of the atmosphere.
5.11.4.2.3	It is the layer we see.
5.11.4.2.4	The next layer out is the chromosphere and it cannot be seen because of the brightness of the photosphere.
5.11.4.2.5	The outer most layer of the atmosphere of the sun is the corona.
5.11.4.2.6	It can only be seen during an eclipse.
5.11.4.2.7	From the corona, solar winds eject material from the sun into space.
5.11.4.3.1	There are 3 main surface features found on the sun as well as any other star.
5.11.4.3.2	A flare is where an eruption on the surface occurs and massive amounts of material are flung into space.
5.11.4.3.3	A prominence is similar to a flare except that because of magnetic field lines on, the flare arches back down to the surface.
5.11.4.3.4	Finally, sunspots are cool, dark regions on the surface that are usually found near prominences and are related to magnetic field lines.
5.11.4.3.5	Key Vocabulary: chromosphere, convection, core, corona, flare, photosphere, prominence, solar wind, sunspot
5.11.5.1.1	Part Four: Stars
5.11.5.1.2	Stars are a large dense concentration of hydrogen gas, fusion in the core causes two hydrogen atoms to form helium.
5.11.5.1.3	A constellation is a group of stars that form a pattern.
5.11.5.1.4	The Big Dipper is an example of a constellation.
5.11.5.2.1	Stars follow a definite development/destruction pattern that is referred to as the life cycle of a star.
5.11.5.2.2	There is a graph called the Hertzprung-Russell Diagram (also called the H-R Diagram) which charts
5.11.5.2.3	stars based on their temperature, luminosity, magnitude and mass.
5.11.5.3.1	A star forms from a spinning cloud of gas and dust called a nebula.
5.11.5.3.2	As the nebula spins, gravity causes it to shrink.
5.11.5.3.3	The spinning nebula flattens into a disk of dust and gas.
5.11.5.4.1	Material comes together at the center of the disk.
5.11.5.4.2	A protostar begins to form.
5.11.5.4.3	A protostar is the material in the center of a nebula that becomes a star.
5.11.5.4.4	The protostar shrinks.
5.11.5.4.5	As it shrinks, temperature and pressure build up.
5.11.5.4.6	When the temperature and pressure are high enough, the protostar starts to give off light and heat.
5.11.5.4.7	It is now a star.
5.11.5.5.1	The most stable phase of stellar life is when it is in the main-sequence stage. This is considered the
5.11.5.5.2	middle age of the life span of a star and it spends most of the time in this stage. Our star is a main-sequence star.
5.11.5.6.1	The ultimate life span of the star depends on its mass.
5.11.5.6.2	Larger mass stars (30 or more times the size of the Sun) will eventually swell to a supergiant.
5.11.5.6.3	From there, the star will explode as a supernova.
5.11.5.6.4	After the supernova stage, the remaining matter collapses into an extremely dense ball and becomes a neutron star and then a black hole.
5.11.5.7.1	Stars that are sun-sized will swell into a red giant, explode into a nova and ultimately collapse into a white dwarf or a black dwarf.
5.11.5.7.2	Key Vocabulary: black dwarf, black hole, constellation, fusion, H-R Diagram, life cycle of stars, main-sequence, nebula, neutron star, nova, protostar, red giant, supergiant, supernova, white dwarf
5.11.6.1.1	Part Five: Galaxies
5.11.6.1.2	In the 1920s, an American astronomer, Edwin Hubble observed some fuzzy patches of light in the sky.
5.11.6.1.3	He discovered that these patches of light were galaxies, made up of millions or billions of stars.
5.11.6.1.4	Galaxies are made up of billions of stars.
5.11.6.1.5	It is estimated that there are over 100 billion galaxies in the universe.
5.11.6.2.1	Galaxies are classified according to their shape.
5.11.6.2.2	Edwin Hubble developed the Hubble Tuning Fork diagram to aid in their classification.
5.11.6.3.1	Spiral galaxies are made up of a central core or nucleus (which usually contains a supermassive black hole) with areas of stars resembling arms coming off of the central core.
5.11.6.3.2	Spiral galaxies have many young stars and star forming regions.
5.11.6.3.3	Barred spiral galaxies also have a central core but there is a bar of stars that come out of the core and the arms only come from the ends of the bars.
5.11.6.4.1	Elliptical galaxies have a central core but no arms.
5.11.6.4.2	The stars are spread out evenly around the core.
5.11.6.4.3	These galaxies may be nearly circular or very elliptical (oval) in shape.
5.11.6.4.4	They are mostly made up of old stars.
5.11.6.5.1	Irregular galaxies have no central core, no arms and no organized shape.
5.11.6.5.2	They tend to be smaller than spirals and ellipticals.
5.11.6.6.1	Our solar system is located in the Milky Way galaxy.
5.11.6.6.2	Key Vocabulary: arms, barred spiral galaxy, black hole, central core, elliptical galaxy, Hubble Tuning Fork, irregular galaxy, Milky Way galaxy, nucleus, spiral galaxy
5.11.7.1.1	Part Six: History and Contributions of the Space Program
5.11.7.1.2	A body that orbits a larger body is called a satellite.
5.11.7.1.3	A moon is considered to be a natural satellite.
5.11.7.1.4	However, since the space program began in the 1950's, there have been many man-made satellites orbiting Earth, both manned and unmanned.
5.11.7.2.1	In 1957 the former Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the Earth's first artificial satellite (remember the movie October Sky?).
5.11.7.3.1	In 1958, the United States launched its first Satellite, Explorer 1.
5.11.7.3.2	The first spacecraft to leave Earth and reach lunar (around the moon) orbit was part of the Luna series of space probes launched by the former Soviet Union.
5.11.7.3.3	At the same time that the Luna series was in progress, the United States launched the Pioneer space probes.
5.11.7.4.1	On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin `Buzz' Aldrin Jr., became the first people to walk on the moon.
5.11.7.4.2	Between 1969 and 1972 the United States sent six Apollo spacecraft to the moon.
5.11.7.4.3	A total of 12 people have walked on the moon.
5.11.7.4.4	2 per successful mission.
5.11.7.5.1	Pioneer, Mariner, Voyager, and Venera are the names of some of the spacecraft launched from Earth to explore the solar system in the 1970's and 1980's.
5.11.7.6.1	The Space Shuttle program began in April 1981, restarting manned space flight.
5.11.7.6.2	Since then, there have been over 100 shuttle missions.
5.11.7.6.3	Many of the shuttle missions were designed to perform rescue and repair missions for satellites already in orbit.
5.11.7.7.1	More recent probes include Spirit, Opportunity and Phoenix which are currently exploring Mars, Cassini and its probe, Huygens, are currently exploring Saturn, Messenger is currently exploring Mercury and New Horizons is on its way to Pluto and should arrive in 2015.
5.11.7.7.2	it left in 2007!
5.11.7.7.3	It will be the first probe sent to Pluto.
5.11.7.7.4	Key Vocabulary: Apollo 11, Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin, Neil Armstrong
5.11.8.1.1	Part Seven: Origin and Evolution of the Universe
5.11.8.1.2	Using the Doppler Effect, Edwin Hubble and other astronomers saw that the galaxies were redshifted which means they are moving away from each other.
5.11.8.1.3	In other words, the universe is expanding.
5.11.8.1.4	Astronomers needed a theory to explain this observation.
5.11.8.1.5	Today scientists have a theory called the Big Bang Theory.
5.11.8.1.6	The "Big Bang" Theory is a leading theory for the formation of the universe.
5.11.8.1.7	According to this theory, approximately 15 billion years ago the universe began expanding out of an enormous explosion.
5.11.8.1.8	The galaxies are still flying away from the point of the big bang.
5.11.8.1.9	After the big bang, the matter in the universe started to condense and form galaxies.
5.11.8.1.10	Galaxies are systems containing millions or even billions of stars.
5.11.8.1.11	We live in the Milky Way, which is a part of a small cluster of 17 galaxies called the local group.
5.11.8.1.12	Key Vocabulary: Big Bang Theory, redshift
